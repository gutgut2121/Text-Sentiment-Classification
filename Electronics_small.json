Thing is, I like to do a lot of hiking and camping.  Typically I&#39;d use my old Garmin GPS with its LCD screen and AA batteries for my navigation.  However, with some of the excellent hiking apps out there, I&#39;ve found myself relying more on my iPhone for navigation duty, and it works well with some significant advantages over my 15 year old Garmin.  Thing is, those iPhones run through their batteries like crazy.Then this device hit my radar and I&#39;m very glad it did.  The footprint on this isn&#39;t so large that making room for it in my ruck is a hassle, and it really is slim - the size of a small paperback book.  It does have some weight to it (which is a welcome thing, I think...beware of manufacturers claiming outrageous capacities that are really light) so you&#39;ll notice it in your pack.  But for multiday hikes it&#39;s just perfect for when you find yourself away from Normal and need to charge your device.I&#39;m able to get 9-10 iPhone charges out of it before it runs out of power, so for those long hikes I think the sheer power capacity justifies the weight.  I won&#39;t rehash the technicals that other reviewers have gone through.  I&#39;ll just say that this device offers serious value and advantages for the money.  It&#39;s well built and solid.  If you and your hiking buddies have need for remote charging of devices far away from any power outlet, this is the item to buy.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;An outstanding product&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1405382400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

The bad is that it only puts out 600mA or so to each battery (supposedly). I do not know what the limit is for charging those NP-Fs is, but 600mA is not exactly a &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; charge. I have seen a few single chargers at 1amp which would have been nice to see here, but that&#39;s about the best I&#39;ve found.Charging the NP-F970s takes a long time. Of course, having the ability to do two at a time does add some efficiency.In any case, I&#39;m not really overly impressed or unimpressed with this, so I&#39;m knocking off a star. IF you have the room, two regular external chargers are probably cheaper. I&#39;d also recommend keeping this somewhere it can get air circulation as with all battery chargers, it can get a little warm sometimes.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Lots of batteries = need for more chargers&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390867200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 28, 2014&quot;}</td>

Everything from wired Sony and Logitech, to Ipod speakers from every corner of the market. I have the Bose Soundock  Portable, which sound great, but are huge and hard to travel with, as I travel to many countries each year on vacation. I found this a few months ago, and let me tell you, they sound better than the Soundock, they even sound better than most peoples home theater. I have the Marshall Bluetooth speakers, which sound just as good, but are HUGE!. The fit in your pocket if you are wearing cargo shorts. And they have plenty of bass and plenty of treble. Some of the best sounding speakers I have ever heard, and I spend a lot of money on speakers. When I have guest over, I do not turn on my NAD T 787 amp, I get my Ipad and connect it to these. Sounds just as good for one or two rooms. If you are looking for portable bluetooth speakers, buy these. You can carry them anywhere you go.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Best Portable Speaker Ever&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401408000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

The 60 inch has a solid 30 x 9.5 wall plate; no joint.  The mounting hooks on the 70 are 1.25 inches wide, but the 60&#39;s are ~2 inches wide,  which spreads out the weight across the bar a little better.  Both mounts are rated at 165 pounds, but the 60 is a more heavy duty product, weighing 12 pounds whereas the 70 only weighs 10.  So, I installed the 80 with the 60 kit and re-installed the Sony with the 70 kit.  I&#39;m not recommending to anyone to use a 60 inch mount for a 70 or 80 inch tv; I&#39;m comparing these 2 to assist you in making a decision.  Also, others are writing about cheap bolts, but there is nothing wrong with the included bolts in either kit.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I wouldn&#39;t trust it with anything above a 60 inch&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401321600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 29, 2014&quot;}</td>

It slides directly into the USB port - It is the exact dimensions of a USB plug, but about 2 inches in length. Unlike some ultra-small sticks, this one has enough size to be pretty easy to keep track of but if you are worried, just attach a lanyard to the convenient hole carved on one end.So, fast, sleek, durable. Highly recommended.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;My new favorite USB memory stick&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396224000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 31, 2014&quot;}</td>

The starter version has limited functions. I tried the free Open Office from Oracle, but it also missed some functions. I don&#39;t want to spend that much money on a full-blown Microsoft office package. So, I come to the Corel WordPerfect Office X7. So far, I am pretty happy with it. The WordPerfect Office can take all the file formats generated from Microsoft Office. So, there is no compatibility issue. Also, WordPerfect Office allows me to save files in all kind of formats. I specifically like how easy to move margin in document with WordPerfect office.The WordPerfect Office is fully PDF friendly. Not only I can save document in PDF form, I can also open a PDF file and edit it directly. I am a big fan for paperless office. I scan most of my documents into searchable (or editable) PDF files (not the image-based PDF file format.). I constantly find myself looking for efficient ways to edit PDF files. WordPerfect Office X7 meets my expectation on this with high scores.By the way, this package is for one machine only. Though if you replace your computer with a new one, Corel allows you to install another copy to the new computer.All in all, as an regular at-home user, I love the price and the features provided by Wordperfect Office. It&#39;s a good value.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;No MS office compatibility issue. Very PDF friendly. Great value for the money.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404259200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

I was a bit apprehensive while hovering over the submit order button, but I figured you can&#39;t win if you don&#39;t enter.Package arrived today, was already set up at my pc to get them connected to my LAN.  I hooked up one camera at a time, it came up as 192.168.1.108, as others have mentioned.  After I added my static IP to the camera, then added that to my router, rebooted router and cam, everything came up as expected.Though I will mention I was not able to log into the cams in IE, but Firefox worked just fine after clicking to tell Firefox it was ok to connect to it.All packaging was in order, CD coasters, screws, drill template, even the cover for the Cat5e to make it waterproof was in each box.  I ordered 4, all which came in factory sealed boxes.Video quality is quite good, I&#39;m not covering a shopping mall, so 1.3 MP is fine for my setup.  The only other concern I had was mounting, since I am removing a defective system (whole other story), holes have already been drilled.  My concern was would the &amp;#34;eyeball&amp;#34; be able to turn enough to still give my view angle needed on a vertical wall.  Indeed it does, unless you want to go real fancy on your install, mounts are not really needed.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Will buy more&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403568000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 24, 2014&quot;}</td>

It&#39;s a precision instrument that demands care and if you aren&#39;t that kind of person, maybe you should be looking at something different.  The Pro-ject Essential is a beautiful table for $300 and I highly suggests a beginner to start with something like that.  Because of the cartridge design, you can improve your sound by simply buying a better stylus in the line (OM10, OM20, OM25, OM30, OM40) and you never need to change the cartridge.The arm on the RP1 is far superior to most in this price range and has the anti-skate set by slide that changes the magnetic setting.  The table will accept virtually any price cartridge and do it justice and some of the others in this price range won&#39;t.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Excellent - Not for beginners&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396310400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

I was hoping that these, with just the wire connecting the two earbuds, would be a good alternative.  Overall, I like these, but there are a couple minor issues that could use improvement.  First the battery life is pretty bad.  3-4 hours of continuous use is all I get from a charge.  The in ear fit is ok, but could be better.  The little loops that tuck into your ear don&#39;t seem to do much, and I think I could get a better fit if I can find some comply foam tips to that fit these.  Also, the coating on the wire has some grip to it.  Depending on the shirt I wear, the wire sometimes grabs on the back of my shirt or neck when I turn my head and pulls the earbuds out of my ears a little.Other than the battery issue, I prefer these over the LG headset.

While I&#39;ve long shunned the freebees, upgrades have included hand-made but unbranded to some of the better known brands found in retail stores. After some search and study, I decided to try these Audioquest Evergreens.Audioquest has a wide range in quality and price and these sit on the low end of the scale. But one has to determine what their own budget will allow. The bottom line is that I&#39;ve been very happy with the product. I replaced virtually all my interconnects in two room with these cables. Does it make a difference? You bet. How much will likely depend on your ears and the quality of your other components. For me, this was an important upgrade. They are sturdy but pliable and include directional arrows on the housing to help with the end that is input and the end that is output.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A terrific audio upgrade for budget minded audiophiles&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390953600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 29, 2014&quot;}</td>

For one thing they are super comfortable. For another the sound is incredible. In fact I have been testing various phones - mainly from this brand, but also some Sennheiser models - and this is head and shoulders above the pack.I&#39;ll be honest and disclose that comfort edges out sound when phones sound good enough. I will normally not quibble over a few hundred Hz one way or the other as long as I can wear the phones without noticing them. These are not only unobtrusive, but downright comfortable, which is a major reason why these have now replaced my trustyBrainwavz HM9 Hi-Fi Noise Isolating Headphones.Soundwise the specs do not begin to describe the richness, especially bass. In fact, when I read the 20 Hz to 20 MHz range I thought that the sound would be somewhat generic for phones in this range. I own a pair of IEMs (in-ear monitors) that go as low as 18 Hz at the same 95dB at 1mW sensitivity, yet these sound much deeper than those. I love the balance of sound across the frequency spectrum as though it&#39;s on a smooth continuum. Every one of my test albums I played through these phones sounded so good that I decided that it&#39;s time to hang up the headphones and go with these.Part of the reason why I love these from a comfort perspective is the over the ear memory wire. I prefer that style, but not everyone does. They are definitely stiff and take on a shape that will be uniquely yours over time (and a very short time at that!) Also, while this ships with aBrainwavz Hard Earphone Casethe phones will not fit after you have contoured them to your ear. The case is useful for carrying around the array of adapters and tips that are included. In fact, the final reason I love these phones is the included triple-flange style silicon tips, which block out the rest of the world and allow me to focus solely on music.If you love music and want to hear every note faithfully reproduced in their natural frequencies these phones are it. I can honestly say that I have not used a better set of phones from any brand in this price range, including some Sennheiser models that have a street price of fifty to seventy-five dollars more than these, so the value is definitely there.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;These won me over&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395100800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

It is Crap! The picture is blotchy, the colors are wildly different from channel to channel, if you are on a screen with a solid color you will see the waviness of the lighting in the TV, the magic remote voice commands only work for the LG Store that is not even open yet so that means that you cannot even use that function, the Netflix id set-up by a third party and I have been getting a run around trying to get my subscription set-up because they will not send me an activation code until I email them a picture of the TV and a bill of sale for which the link that they give me to set that up is not functioning so it could be weeks before I get the subscription and if it does not happen before the Amazon return period I am going to return the TV, You basically have to use all of your remotes that they claim that this remote will take the place of but what they do not tell you is that you have to push the 124 button on the remote and a screen pops-up so you can hover the pointer over the numbers of the channel that you want to watch making it take at least 20 seconds to even turn the channel with the remote that comes with the TV, if you read the manual it says there is another remote you can buy and I am sure that it is better than the voice activated remote that cannot even be used, PERIOD!!!! The worst electronic device I have ever had to return.Add-on: This TV also will not connect to a network to play any media that you have stored on any type of drive. It will plat a movie that is on a USB though but the connections are unreachable so you have to leave a wire dangling from the TV to connect the USB. The LG Marketplace started working but it is all \&quot;Pay Per Anything\&quot; and the new channels are clips of whatever garbage that they decide to fill your head with to keep you from current event, just AWFUL! I have tried to adjust the color on the TV so many different ways that I know for certain it is the sorriest display that I have ever seen in my life. Anything black if a flat cutout looking image and the detail in it cannot be adjusted out. I bought this for my elderly parents and they asked me why it looks so bad, imagine that!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;On the verge of returning it!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402876800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

There was all types of crackle on the bass and I had to turn the tv up to 98 when watching movies.In any event this is simply the first part of the review as I have not had the chance to really put the system through it s paces. I just set it up last night and it was too late in the evening to be pumping out loud audio.I mainly wanted to share my initial impressions concerning the build quality and the setup.This is the first set of dedicated home speakers that I have ever purchased so I dont really have a solid frame of reference. Growing up I just used my Phillips home stereo cd/cassette player to output richer sound from my tv.The speakers and sub woofer are made of high grade glossy plastic. I am not mounting the speaker so I cant speak much to that but it certainly appears as though it would be a relatively painless process as they seem to give you everything you would need. I want to say the speakers feel good in your hands and are very dense and weighty . The design on them is striking and overall It really looks like a high quality 2.1 system. I was very impressed. I cant really over state the feel. Not that you will be going up and touching your speakers often but everything from the sat. speaker connectors on the woofer feel very well made. The only exception is the sensor fab. its made of a lower grade of plastic.In any event I had the system up and running in about 20 mins. Would take less time if you have a specific place for your equipment already etched out.So as far as audio I can only say right now that the low volume range is far greater than on my tv. I have a much larger lever of incremental range between no sound and comfortable low sound. Voices came through clear and seemed to be balanced which is a problem I often had with my tv speakers, where the music would overshadow voice overs.Will update when I have time to do better sound tests.Inputs 3.5mm Aux port, Red and white composite in, Digital optical audio port and Bluetooth.Looking forward to testing the Bluetooth playback. As a feature I&#39;m really looking forward to that.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Quality speakers for an affordable cost.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396396800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

Originally I had 2 of these, each of which was plugged into an ethernet switch, and the whole system, in 2 different rooms, was connected via a \&quot;Powerline\&quot; adapter.  Plugging directly into switches rather than into the router made it so this set up sort of worked most of the time, however there were still quite a lot of issues that I now believe were due to the use of Powerline adapters.  I ultimately had my house wired for ethernet cable, and now that I am no longer using powerline adapters and everything is wired directly, there are almost no issues with this product.  In addition, Silicondust continues to update their firmware and drivers, and I have found that these recent updates since I bought the 2 tuners have made the system much more stable.  Unless you are going to use these with a wired ethernet system I think you could just save yourself a lot of grief and use your cable company&#39;s standard DVR boxes and call it a day, since wireless and or bridging adapter technology such as MOCA or Powerline adapters are probably unlikely to give you a satisfactory experience with this Silicondust tuner product.Original Review below:There are hundreds if not thousands of online reviews of this product, many of which go into great detail.  I have owned two of these tuners for about 2 months now.  I have had quite a few issues with \&quot;lost tuner\&quot; type error messages, issues with Windows Media Center, etc., but have worked through most of them and for the most part I get stable performance with these.Don&#39;t rely on streaming HD Video throughout your house via wireless; it might happen at least some of the time, but don&#39;t count on it.  Wires are your friend :-)  Routers tend to mess up the HD TV signals that come out of these tuners.  If at all possible, invest in a gigabit switch and then plug the tuner and your computer that will be recording shows into the switch, NOT into the router.  In this set up the TV signals will remain in the switch except to the extent that they get broadcast outside of the switch and through the rest of your network.  If you plug this device and your computer&#39;s Ethernet cord into the same gigabit switch, the router will not have the opportunity to scramble or screw up the TV signals and you should be able to get good reception and recordings on your TV.  When isolated in a switch, all the router does is to assign an IP address to the traffic, but does not process the intra switch traffic.I am using Windows 7 Media Center.  Like all Microsoft products, it works well except when it doesn&#39;t :-)  If your recordings are important to you, then consider REDUNDANCY.  I have two of these SD HD Homerun Primes, in separate rooms, each plugged into gigabit switches, into which are also plugged in the TVs that are used for viewing and recording the programs.  Each computer independently records each of the programs I want to record.  That way, if one of the systems fails, the other one almost always gets the program recorded and you can transfer the missed programs to the other one on a portable hard disk or USB drive.  In my particular case, the connection between the router and the \&quot;second independent system plugged into a gigabit switch\&quot; is a set of powerline adapters, however you could do this in any of several ways to connect the two systems (Cat 5e or 6 cable would be best but is not an easy option in my house).  With this sort of hardware (and software, especially if Microshaft is involved) redundancy is your friend.My only caution would be that these things likely will require some technical capabilities and a lot of patience on your part to get installed and running reliably.  If you are not a technically oriented person, and if you can&#39;t deal with frustration, LOTS of frustration, do yourself a favor and have your Cable Guy install whatever system the cable provider is hawking at the moment.  You&#39;ll sleep better.Good luck.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Some operational issues but would not go back&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391558400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 5, 2014&quot;}</td>

These weigh half as much as the OEM Nikon batteries, now I can&#39;t say for certain this really means anything but it at least says these are not manufactured in the same place with the same processes as the OEM units (which is by far the most desirable aftermarket product type). The batteries simply don&#39;t last very long, I get about 20 or so shots with my 105mm prime lens and the battery drops from full to one bar all of a sudden; I have had this happen multiple times with both the batteries and my OEM batteries take many more (100+ pics) with that lens without a problem.The Charger: The unit my kit came with is made by Vivitar, not known for top notch products but usually functional to a point... In this case the charger seems to charge the battery eventually; operative word being &amp;#34;eventually&amp;#34;.

It with me everyday, everywhere I go and I use my tablet a lot and after 5 months, it is still in tact. It&#39;s a bit hard to line up the camera holes so you do have parts of the case showing in your picture, but it is perfectly possible. I fine that it is not so much a  problem of the case not fitting properly, but lining up the inside part of the case to the outside part. It works great as a horizontal stand in all the positions. The Stylus/ Pen that comes with it is very nice and thin. It&#39;s nice to hold and has two colors, black and blue. The stylus works great and does stick when you swipe it across the screen.Here are the things I don&#39;t like about the case. It is not very stable in the vertical position as a stand. It is hard to perfectly line up the camera holes if you decide you want to use it in the vertical position, so I just don&#39;t even bother to do that. It would have been much better if it rotated instead of having to separate and re attach it. It is a very bulky case, it adds about 2.5 times the thickness of the Nexux 7FHD. But I have dropped the tablet in the case a countless amount of times and there isn&#39;t even a scratch on the tablet.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Sturdy high quality case, but bulky.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390176000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 20, 2014&quot;}</td>

In the hand, it has a nice solid feel. The body is plastic, with a high gloss, two tone color scheme of white and blue. Also, the AC prongs fold into the charger, which makes it easier to carry in the pocket (less scratches on your leg).This charger plugs directly into the wall, which might be a hang up for some. I do not see this as problem since I am able to charge two devices at the same time in one location. Before this charger, I would have to charge devices all over the house, now those dreadful memories are a thing of the past.Before using, be sure to use the correct port you need for the device being charged. You can charge up to two devices at the same time, but the maximum overall output will be limited to 3.1A. This can be seen as a gift or curse, to me it is a gift. Being able to charge a diverse group of devices is a great thing.I use this single charger on my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and Galaxy Note 2 at the same time. Now I can charge my devices all in one place, which is much easier.This is a must have charger if you have multiple mobile devices!CONTENTS:iXCC Dual Port USB Wall ChargerUser ManualFEATURES:Input: 350mAOutput: DC 5V/3.1A MaxUSB Output Ports: Port 1 5V/3.1A, Port 2 5V/1AFolding AC Prongs: YesDimension: 2.6 x 2.0 x 1.1in (66 x 51 x 28mm)Weight: 2.47oz (70g)Warranty: 1 YearI was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Small In The Hand, Big On Power&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394150400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

The replacement unit addressed the port sizing issues described below and I&#39;ve had no issues with any USB devices not fitting into any of the hub&#39;s ports. Great customer service and the replacement product works as advertised.  I&#39;d certainly recommend this product (and more importantly, this company) to anyone.  It also goes to show the importance of honestly reviewing products you purchase online.  You might be pleasantly surprised by the experience.ORIGINAL REVIEW (3/5 stars): I picked this up because my new laptop only has 2 USB ports and I was consuming both of them between my mouse&#39;s receiver and my required GbE dongle... this does what it purports and turns 1 port into 4, but I have issues with some USB devices even fitting into the ports (my mouse&#39;s receiver was one. I&#39;ve had 2 or 3 USB thumb drives that were difficult to insert).  After fiddling a bit, I was able to get the thumb drives inserted, but the mouse receiver is still a no-go.  I&#39;ve since replaced the mouse with a true bluetooth mouse that requires no receiver and picked up a USB 3.0 dual-head graphics adapter that includes a GbE port as well so the need to use this regularly no longer exists. In a pinch I can use it to connect a couple of devices when I need to but it&#39;s not the best experience I&#39;ve had and I could only recommend it to someone who&#39;s knowledgeable enough to know what should be able to connect so they are willing to force the adapters into the ports.  Definitely not \&quot;mom proof.\&quot;&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;USB 3.0 and compact, but not ports are tight...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398211200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 23, 2014&quot;}</td>

I thought I had it working before but when I tried it just now the highlighted area doesn&#39;t move. The Logitech forums says it also works with Windows 7 and 8, if your PC has a USB Bluetooth adapter, which I need to get. As to why Logitech does not offer an optional USB Bluetooth adapter is beyond me. They are letting other companies cash in on this. Oh well.Pairing was fast and easy on my ipad2, and even on my TV. I only needed to enter a 5 digit number using the keyboard and it was done.The keyboard is thin, looks nice, and lights up when your hand gets close to it, then auto dims when you set it aside.

They had the crappy v-tech kid cameras, which died on their own (pretty much) after 3 years (I only say crappy, because the image quality and video size was poor, and the little video games were annoying to me, but they enjoyed them).  Well, Santa dropped the cameras off almost 5 months ago, and we haven&#39;t needed the warranty yet, but it&#39;s just a matter of time... they&#39;re doing their best, but they&#39;re 9, and they&#39;re twin boys, and, well, the odds just aren&#39;t in the warranty company&#39;s favor.

S. Gilbert&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;First let me start with the good. The reflectors seem to be well made. The zipper seems durable enough for the constant switching to the opposite side I&#39;ll have to do, but the zipper also makes it difficult to get the reflector into the clamps on the boom arm. I really needed a reflector with black and white on opposite sides. This one has black which reverses to white on one side with gold to silver on the other. This reversible cover fits over a white diffuser panel giving the 5 in 1 options. Good reflector otherwise.Second is the bad and it&#39;s all about stand. The stand itself is fine. Light weight, but then that&#39;s what i needed as I&#39;ll be carrying it to locations. I&#39;ll have to buy a case as there isn&#39;t one in the kit. Something I overlooked when purchasing... Lesson learned. I&#39;ll also need sandbags as the reflector will be gone with the wind otherwise. In a good gust sandbags probably won&#39;t be enough. (Sigh!) Next is that contraption for mounting the boom arm to the stand. This is the most worthless piece in the kit! I found the video on YouTube ([...]) with instructions for assembly of this, but honestly it looked as if even she could not get it to tighten on the stand during the video, which is the same problem I am having.All in all I&#39;ll keep the reflector but purchase another. The stand, maybe I can use it for a speedlite. The boom, or at least the contraption to connect the boom arm to the stand, will probably be land fill.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Very Disappointed With Stand And Reflectors&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392249600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 13, 2014&quot;}</td>

Seriously its hard to find a comparable SLR bag for less then 100$The bag has a lot of roomThe bag fairly well protected.

The Pentax K100D camera is a very basic camera that is best for people new to DSLR photography.  The Pentax K100D camera is simple to use since it kacjs the more complex features of higher end DSLRS.  I would not pay more than $250 dollars for a very good condition Pentax K100D camera  unless you must have one in new condition.  I was able to get some really great very good condition Pentax K100D camera&#39;s for about $200 each total with shipping.  I brought 3 of the Pentax K100D camera model.  I love that this camera takes standard AA batteries.  One reviewer states the AA batteries did not last. I took over 200 pictures out and about in my home town Towson, Maryland and never changed the baterries. I took more than 75 flash pictures in my house without needing to change batteries.  I just used Duracell&#39;s.  I have rechargable AA batteries I just have not started using them in my Pentax K100D camera.The pictures right out of the camera are awesome.  I shoot in raw format, keeping the RAW file and converting copies of the raw file to JPG or TIFF images for common production use. The camera has no video feature but I neither want or miss it. I have a dedicated video camera for making quality video movies. The Pentax K100D camera  accepts the standard K Pentax lenses.  The Pentax K100D camera is a stubby little camera great for a person like me with small hands. My big 6 ft 8 in 298 pound brother has hands the size of baseball mitts but he can navigate this camera&#39;s controls with only slight issues.I have found this Pentax K100D camera  to be a great beginners camera and a great backup camera.  I have a Pentax K30 and a Pentax K5 but I am not yet a true photographer. I am still learning my hobby of photography. When I am good enough to leave auto focus for good and have some camera skills I will move up to my K5.  While I am still learning my DSLR basics the Pentax K100D camera  gives me the freedom to learn, make mistakes and recover quickly. I do better with learning when I do not fear making a mistake. The Pentax K100D camera is a cheap basic DSLR that takes great pictures while teaching you DSLR basics.The Pentax K100D camera has only six megapixels, 6 MP which is more than enough for my picture taking needs since I will never produce images over 8\&quot; x 10\&quot;.  If I ever need poster sized prints I&#39;ll haul out my Pentax K5 and shoot till I get what I want. This is a great camera even in the aftersale \\ used marketplace. If you want a quality AA battery powered DSLR camera at a good price in reasonable condition I&#39;d act now. I have cerebral palsyand do not drive. You can buy AA batteries in almost any hotel lobby shop, convenience martor drug store. Custom batteries require you to drive all over.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;THE BEST PENTAX CAMERA IN MY INVENTORY AND THE CHEAPEST...BEST VERY BASIC BACKUP CAMERA YOU CAN EVER HOPE FOR!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398038400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 21, 2014&quot;}</td>

The bass on these is really clear and plenty strong. Sound quality is fine too. (I&#39;m not an audiophile so these do the job great. I have not tried out the mic yet but Ill update my review after i use it. In pictures it looks oddly bulky and a tad ugly but in person these look great. Blue and black are two of my favorite colors, so it&#39;s a sexy win win. This thing comes with a neato USB adapter that you can stick in your ps3 or xbox. That should justify the $50 price tag for these. The cord seems insanely sturdy and it even comes with a good volume control button on it, so again you can control the volume when playing on a console. The only thing that really bothers me about this is that there is INSANE sound leak. I am positive it was made intentionally by design so you can get some airflow. However, it&#39;s kind of bad. The volume has to be below half or else I&#39;d wake my parents up -_-&amp;#34;. So if you live with a partner or share the room with anyone else at night, you will not be able to listen to your games at a decent volume because there is simply TOO MUCH sound leak. If sound leak isn&#39;t a huge issue to you then BUY THESE HEADPHONES already.

Now that the SDK is out we should start to see more and more companies adding casting to their apps. Simple set up, (one small note, I was unable to get the dongle setup using my Galaxy S4, however, once I installed the app on my laptop, within 2 minutes the setup was complete). So if your having problems using the setup on your phone, switch to a laptop, or tablet. So easy I bought a second one. And if your like me and have only one USB port on your TV, just get a splitter. My Leaf antenna needs USB power as well as the Chromecast, an unpowered splitter works just fine.Pros: Easy setupTucks out of the way behind the TVUn-powered USBCons: Need more Apps for casting, not really a con on Chromecast, just had to say it.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;overall&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">5.0</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;summary&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Buy it<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;unixReviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">1394150400</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;reviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>03 7, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

I used to have older APC models but the batteries died and it was either buy replacement batteries or spend $50 more for these units.  These units have the added benefit of a main plug that when it draws less than the specified amount (sleep mode on a computer or shutting a tv off) other plugs can be disabled to stop drawing power when the main device is off.  This does have a negative but it doesn&#39;t bother me.  Since I had so many plugs on 1 unit that I wanted to stay on on the time and so many that I wanted to shut off on my other unit I had to add power strips in to connect everything to the type of plug I wanted.  Also keep in mind this isn&#39;t meant to keep your devices on for long periods of time.  It is meant to give you time to shut everything off.  At about half draw (400 watts) I get about 10 minutes.  At 250 watts I get 30 minutes.  Another useful feature is this unit has a led screen that can tell you the amount of time left, watts being used, and more.  Since I use this with home theater equipment I was worried the screen would stay on all the time.  The screen shuts off if you are not actively pushing buttons.  However the buttons do stay lit all the time.  They were easily dimmed using LightDims.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great for keeping sensitive electronics safe&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396742400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

I&#39;ll just copy and paste the review I did for theGE 24792 Compact Attic Mount Antenna with Mount:-------------------------------------------\&quot; I&#39;m amazed by this little GE antenna. Before carrying it to the attic, I wanted to see if it would perform next to my TV&#39;s with a 3 foot cable and no preamp. On one TV I got around 35% signal strength on 4 of 5 UHF stations that are about 57 miles away (a couple are 22-27 miles). This was in the center of my house, 8 ft off the ground (crawlspace + my height). The signal was beaming through a bedroom, so at least two walls to get to the outside. Also, I&#39;m aiming through trees (tall oaks, trunks only) and hilly terrain.  I&#39;m going to compare this antenna to (1) a 15 year old 8 bay with 300ohm connector and a 15 year old channel master preamp, (2) a Channel Master CM-4228 antenna and Channel Master CM-7778 preamp, (3) G.E. Attic antenna and Channel Master CM-7778 preamp. All three antennae were tested in the same location in my attic. There was really not a lot of difference in signal strength between the three setups. The GE actually got slightly better performance overall, raising the signal strength 5 points on a couple of channels.In my attic, I&#39;m aiming through the roof, of course. The line of sight is obstructed, again, by the trunks of about six very tall trees, all within 250 feet, with the nearest two being about 50 feet. I mounted the GE at the very top of the roofline rafter. This places the antenna about 25-30 feet above ground level. Here is the signal strength I&#39;m getting on 7 primary channels I can receive using the GE antenna. The mileage is calculated by TVFOOLS.COM. Note that the stations 57 miles away have their tower based on top of a 1,621 foot mountain. My antennae is pointing at 102 degrees. I had a TV close by that I could view from the attic. Cable length was about 35 feetChannel A: 57.3 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 90Channel B: 57.5 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 84Channel C: 57.3 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 83Channel D: 57.6 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 78Channel E: 57.3 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 85Channel F: 22.5 miles, 74 degrees , Signal Strength: 83Channel G: 27.6 miles, 213 degrees, Signal Strength: 71Once I connected my two way splitter and moved the test TV back to the bedroom, I lost about 10 pts of signal on each station, but the picture is still perfect with no pixelation. My TV locations require about 50ft and 75ft of cable from the TV to the antenna. In total, I get about 15 digital channels, with 7 of those being the primary channel.It takes a few minutes to assembly and you have to be careful. The mounting hardware allows you to place the antenna just about anywhere. I have it mounted, hanging down from an angled rafter. TV signals can be strange, so your mileage may vary with any antenna. If you can&#39;t get a signal, no antenna in the world is going to help. \&quot;---------------------------------------------Unfortunately, I had to take a loss shipping this Channel Master back to Amazon ( I kept the preamp). If you plan on mounting outside, then the Channel Master will serve you well as the GE wouldn&#39;t hold up under a Spring breeze.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Not amazed.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396483200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

If you have to buy one, you might want to stick with the original.And I have a lot of questions I found no answers for for the B1 revision so I wrote them a question on their product review page:1. Does this B1 revision support ONVIF?2. Can the lens be changed to wider angle (yes, I know it will void the warranty)?3. What is the size of the dc power jack? I need to mount this 12 feet up the wall and do not want to see the wiring dangling so I need a DC power extension behind the wall. 5.5 mm OD, 2.5 mm ID or 2.1mm ID or something else?4. What is the night vision wavelength?3 days later, I got this back:We thank you for your feedback as we truly appreciate and value it very much. Currently the DCS-5222L does not currently support ONVIF and unfortunately you cannot change out the lens in the DCS-5222L. The 12 V/1.25 A, 50/60 Hz A/C power cable is about 3 feet long and the terminal plug on the end measures roughly 4 inches long, 2 1/2 inches wide and 1 inch deep. The night vision available settings are as follows: 8 meter IR illumination distance, Minimum illumination 0 Lux with IR LED on, Built-in Infrared-Cut Removable (ICR) Filter module, Built-in Passive Infra-Red (PIR), Fixed length 4.57 mm, and Aperture F1.9. If you need additional information please visit [...]. Thank you for choosing D-Link.Well, that shows how ignorant their tech support is.The original non B1 version supports ONVIF and I have been using that so that my GEOVISION server can connect to it. So, B1 revision is a totally different breed? Sure it doesn&#39;t support ONVIF?Size of dc power jack... 5.5 mm OD, 2.5 mm ID or 2.1mm ID or something else! You did not answer my question.Night vision wavelength - 850nm or 940nm or something else! You gave me all unrelated answers!I bet they will not show my response. I bet after they read it, they will revise their first answer but it is too late. I have no faith in them.Still, the build quality of of this camera is much better than many Chinese made ones you can find on ebay.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The newer B1 Revision is out there. DO NOT BUY THIS OLDER version. Or should you?&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401494400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 31, 2014&quot;}</td>

Not ruinous mistakes but nonetheless.I use this to run from my computer or music player / phone / what have you - to my headphones with a line-in jack.Were I using it as a patch cable from a music player to an aux jack in my car, etc it would be fine but as wear it on my head I need more flexibility than is offered by this cable.The flat ribbon-style cable is perfect in theory and the photos make it seem ideal but in actuality it is too thick. It does NOT tangle, I&#39;ll give it that - but were it mildly thinner it would be ideal. It is thick enough that a smaller, regular round cable would be more manageable as this cable tends to find it&#39;s way into my line of sight... constantly following the movement of my head and winding up in front of my keyboard, under my elbow, etc.The plug is also fairly long which I suppose (in retrospect) is noticeable in the photos so I should have considered that. I had the entire scale wrong from looking at the pictures. The silver plug and the ribbon cable are both much bigger and thicker than they seem in scale from that pic.All that said, it sounds good and it does not tangle so it&#39;s very manageable when taking the headset on and off often and shoving the whole mess to the side as I am prone to do.I have yet to experience the need to untie a knot or any other nonsense. I simply pick up the headset and put it back on - it has never caught on itself nor anything else (and THAT makes the rest perfectly acceptable.)&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Flat cable is a good idea poorly implemented&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393372800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

It works great with the Windows 7 drivers and utilities.  Who wants to bring a USB cable around with a portable printer?There are two locations it can be installed, one external and one internal.  Advice: use the external USB connector first until the device is paired with your computer and the drivers and everything is  working, otherwise, you will be taking the cover on and off a few times like I did.  Now that it is working with my computer, it is as if it were attached with the USB cable, so no need to chose a USB or Bluetooth printer when printing.  One printer icon for both.For Ubuntu, the story is sad: there is very little support.  I can send over a file, but if it isn&#39;t plain text (.txt) or a picture (jpeg/tiff), the printer will spit out paper like mad with jibberish all over it.  That&#39;s why the four stars instead of five.  Hopefully, Canon will notice if enough people get fed up with Apple and Microsoft and start using Ubuntu or any other Linux.Pros: wireless, hidden, and seamless support in Windows 7 (use USB cable or Bluetooth with the same &amp;#34;printer&amp;#34; device).Cons: limited Linux/Ubuntu support.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Works well with Windows, limited support for Ubuntu.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401840000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

What happened is I received the card and immediately threw it in the camera and shot a few pics.  It came formatted so that was not an issue.  Then, I read the most popular review for it on here and saw the notes about how you don&#39;t achieve ideal performance until you run a Transcend AutoFormat utility pass over it to re-format the card in complete (slow) mode and then re-do a quick format from the camera.So that&#39;s what I started out trying to do.  Downloaded the AutoFormat utility, began the format process, but it hung at 46.55% and went no further.  Quit, tried again, same point it hangs.  I tried formatting from Windows 7 itself, that ultimately hung and failed after a few hours, same behavior on my MacBook Pro.  I tried AutoFormat once more and this time it produced an actual fail message.  I&#39;m guessing there are some bad memory cells in the card I received.In any case, the purpose of my review is primarily to let you know that with a 64 GB card, that you only quick format, or perhaps just use right out of the box, you may shoot for a while before running into any bad portions and if you reach that point and the filesystem on the card becomes corrupt, you could lose your pictures.  I&#39;d recommend using the AutoFormat utility on any new card just to be sure it can complete the entire pass before you put the card into use.I got a second one from Amazon, no hassle exchange, ran AutoFormat slow mode with zero errors, did quick format in the Canon 5D Mark III, no errors, and have shot on it until full with no issues.  I quick format it frequently in the camera after I&#39;ve transferred images off and have yet to encounter any errors, so I think I just got a bad card, but I still strongly recommend you AutoFormat slow first to ensure your card is 100%.  Transfers on/off are very fast if you have a USB3 card reader.  It&#39;s definitely a pricey card but if you need to do burst shooting in a high-MP DSLR, it&#39;s what you need.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Initial issues&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389225600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

I installed this unit in a 4770k build with a radeon 5870 gpu. The system under max overclock of both the cpu and gpu can only generate 400 watts or so.  With that said, typical idle usage sits around 75 watts and even at roughly 10% output  i generally get around 80% efficiency.  It produces no audible capacitor wine that I could detect with the fan in 0 rpm mode and my ear right on it.  The corsair link software is fun to play with, but somewhat unreliable (particularly when recovering from sleep mode).  I also think the software would be much more practical with fine grain details (I&#39;d like to see how many watts my hdd/gpu is pulling at any given moment)  It&#39;s nice to have a virtual rail that can cut power, but I don&#39;t really feel that watching my pcie draw 2 amps is particularly useful.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Quiet and Cool&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400025600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 14, 2014&quot;}</td>

My d-3300 works pretty well with this. NOTE BENE: use the timer button, which is the lowest on the right rear of the camera body, to avoid having to dig through three layers of menus. The range seems decent- about 10-15&#39; in shade, about 5&#39; in sunlight. It&#39;s great for macro, as it avoids motion caused by physically depressing the shutter switch- and the resulting loss of sharpness.

I&#39;m so glad that I did as it&#39;s made me much less uneasy about going out for long times when I&#39;m expecting an important call, but I&#39;m not where I can charge the phone.I highly recommend this device.

I will freely admit however that I bought one set before that - my original purchase, which was then replaced under warranty by Logitech. That in and of itself was a PITA. The first customer service person I talked to insisted it was my computer that couldn&#39;t pick up sounds, but really it was the mic that had gone out on it. When I called back and mentioned I was using it for Ventrillo, the second guy said &#39;oh, you know what you&#39;re doing&#39;. Have to say, as annoyed as I was by the first customer service guy, that was kind of a relief to hear.The replacement unit has been going strong ever since I get it replaced. As I said, the USB plug is beginning to die, but only because I&#39;ve yanked it around out of the plug many times. I&#39;m amazed I got this much use out of it. The vinyl covering the headset pads started to deteriorate over a year ago, but I figured as long as they work, I can live with it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Purchased 2008...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398038400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 21, 2014&quot;}</td>

The speakers are small, so they won&#39;t fill a concert hall, but they will fill an averages size room.  The sound is quite good.

These speakers took a Schubert piano CD to the next level. The CD was from the 70&#39;s and had been put into CD format. The music was wonderful, but it just had &amp;#34;no life&amp;#34; to it. We didn&#39;t know if it was the recording or the piano. This helped tremendously. The piano is still a bit tinny, but we can at least get everything it has! Highs, lows, and mid are all great!Why not 5 Stars? The funky connector setup is silly. It works fine but just complicates the installation. Standard connectors would work just fine.

Miller \&quot;IdoNotes\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [1, 1], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;With the fierce competition of headphones out there, finding a sleek and effective pair is getting harder to find. This pair fills that gap between too expensive and cheaply made without sacrificing quality for iOS devices.The look of the headphones was clean and the magnetic and interchangeable colored panels (they call them tags) on the earpieces allow you to have some customization in the look. I like that the headphones came with two additional sets of colors.  You can see how it looks in their images above. They panels were so simple to swap out.The foam padding around the ear pieces felt great. While these are not noise cancelling headphones, the memory foam did reduce some outside noise. Not having the noise reduction technology keeps the cost down as well. I wore them around the house for quite a long time. Most headphones begin to hurt after a while. I did not notice that with these.  I also like how the earpieces folded down to allow you to hang them on your neck easier when not in use.The audio quality was not bad at all. These are not perfection for the audiophile nor or they meant to be. It did not have the heavy bass enhancements most headphones try now thinking that makes everything better. They played cleanly and sounded good.  The in-line audio controls on the cord allowed you start/stop/forward/back of your audio.The in-line controller also has a noise reduction microphone for use as a phone headset. Hearing the other caller was clear and they did not have any complaints over my voice quality until the in-line controller rolled over. I love how they made the controller closer to the face instead of way down the cord. This means the microphone for the phone is actually near my mouth.  They were missing a clip to hold it at the right angle though. You can also use the in-line controller to pick up and disconnect from calls.The packaging itself was a little overkill to be honest. They could reduce that down a bunch. It is like they tried to make it stand out on the gaming shelves (they have many headsets in that area) or against other headsets.Overall, a recommended product with good sound, good pricing, audio controls and double use as a phone headset for iOS devices.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Ok, I was impressed&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403740800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

This cable worked just perfectly, and despite everyone thinking that you absolutely NEED &amp;#34;studio monitors&amp;#34; - my 80w pioneer bookshelf speakers are perfectly fine, and are about 100x better than my piece of crap M Audios ever were.I realize I&#39;m going from balanced to unbalanced, but meh...still sounds absolutely fine.Great cable, well made - I also have a Hosa 90 degree angle guitar cables for my pedal board/effects loop, and am very happy with the quality of those as well.As most people say here, Hosa is a crazy good deal for what they are.

They were sleek and almost like an Apple product.  Even the fresh, white coloring is a nice touch to these babies.  They were also sturdy when taking them out of the box.  The band is very strong.  The top band is also comfortable.The earcups are also large enough for big ears, like myself.  But when I put the headphones on, I noticed two huge problems.The headphones are too tight of a fit for my head (7 5/8 hat size right now).  I think they&#39;ll break in, but it&#39;s quite the vice right now.If that wasn&#39;t the dealbreaker, the sound quality sure is.  It&#39;s HORRIBLY muffled.  As clear as a cheap boombox from the 90s.  Heck, maybe even my boombox was clearer than these guys.  They sound like when I had a double ear infection when compared to my current Shure 440&#39;s.Very, very disappointed in this product (especially when I own Panasonic products, such as a Plasma TV) and it will be packed back to Amazon tomorrow.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;SOLID construction, but horrible! sound quality&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391040000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

At a full +12 db Bass, the headphones will rumble like rolling thunder, and increasing the treble will yield higher highs.-Bass: Excellent bass potential, should the user desire so. I would call myself a slight &amp;#34;bass head&amp;#34; and I think these cans function well in feeding my addiction.-Mic: Has an audio playback feature so you&#39;re not screaming at the top of your lungs, but doesn&#39;t function as well at higher volumes. Friends say there&#39;s significantly less background noise than my last set, so that&#39;s a plus. Mic mutes when lifted all the way, good feature.-Sound leak: They&#39;re very good at keeping sound in. Roommates say they can&#39;t hear my dubstep when I blast it at full volume when they&#39;re a few feet away.-Includes voice changer software as well that includes 6 voices, 2 of them absolutely hilarious and make my friends soil themselves with laughter most of the time, those being Giant and Space Squirrel.-Surround Sound: I don&#39;t think that I can ever go back to non-surround sound headsets. Virtual it may be, it&#39;s still mind-blowing to hear the audio from every* direction.-Programmable G-keys are functional and useful if you can think of a need to use them. Definitely a lot of capabilities there.-Loud. High audio possibilities.-Thick, sturdy cable of a wire.There&#39;s only one con, but...it&#39;s huge.-The headphones, because they&#39;re USB, CONSTANTLY DISCONNECT FROM MY COMPUTER AND NEVER WANT TO GO BACK TO FUNCTIONING. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the headphones or if it&#39;s my crappy USB ports, but I&#39;ll go days without issue and then it&#39;ll happen 4 times in an hour on Skype. I don&#39;t know.Overall, definitely worth the $80 of Christmas money I spent for these (great sale).

They arrived in what looked like homemade packaging and very late, given the shipping that I paid for.  Amateur hour at best.  I have to wonder who we are dealing with.  It is a real antenna and it does send/receive a better signal than what I was using before.  Sadly, neither of the antennas will stand up on their own and need external support.  That&#39;s OK in my situation, but it may not be for many others.  There is zero support documentation offered with this product, not even a few suggestions about how to orient the antennas for best performance.  Nothing.  Attempts to contact the vendor bombed - no phone number other than a recording, no website and several direct emails have gone  **unanswered** for several weeks.  This is NOT an A++ vendor.IMO, Amaxon should monitor these fringe vendors more closely - or simply stop using them.  On the future, if the produce is is not marked &amp;#34;Sold and delivered by Amazon,&amp;#34; (or what ever it says), I&#39;m NOT buying.  If the product comes from Amazon, someone is accountable and returns are trouble-free when rarely necessary.  When dealing with the second or third string of Amazon&#39;s add-on vendors, the results are mixed.  Never again will I use one of them.  Period.  -C.  This product may have potential, but as-is, I found it essentially worthless.  If you are a radio engineer and know how to aim antennas, it may work for you.  If you can follow simple instructions, it may work for you, but ONLY if you can get some simple instructions.  I did not get any and I cannot find any.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;How to Use it?

Daniel Spratlin&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [2, 2], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;I bought the Acer C720 to have something lighter to carry around. I have a Dell Windows laptop that&#39;s has incredible specs; however, I don&#39;t find myself ever using it to its maximum capabilities. So why should I drag around 6.5 lbs with me all day? The Acer C720 is incredibly light and it&#39;s much thinner than it appears in the pictures. The build is very nice for a $199 laptop. It uses a sturdy matte colored plastic which I actually find rather attractive. It doesn&#39;t look toy-like.The screen is something that many people have complained about but I find it perfectly satisfactory. The resolution is good enough for the size of the screen and it&#39;s plenty bright to be used in sunlight especially since it&#39;s a matte display. The keyboard is nicely spaced and the keys feel okay at best. The keys are very shallow which I don&#39;t particularly like but I can understand why they had to do that. It takes a little bit of time to get used to but after a day&#39;s use, the keyboard should feel fine. My WPM fell about 10 from my average 85-90 WPM on a desktop keyboard but after several days, I&#39;m starting to get back up to that range. The trackpad is really nice. It has a nice smooth texture and it&#39;s responsive. I don&#39;t know what some of the other review have been saying about it being loose. Mine is definitely sturdy. It does make a loud click but if you turn on &amp;#34;tap to click&amp;#34; you&#39;ll only actually have to make a loud click when you have to grab and drag something.I bought this laptop to primarily use out and about for work so it was very important for me to have it open my PDFs. I put my PDF files on the 16gb hard drive and they open right up with the Chrome PDF viewer. Perfect! All of my documents, music, and photos were already in the Google cloud so as soon as I turned the laptop on, everything was ready to be viewed.The battery is rather amazing as well considering how light this laptop is. The machine came with no power. Once I plugged it in, it took just over an hour to charge. On my first charge, I&#39;ve managed to get just under 9 hours! Wow! My usage was pretty light though. Primarily opening up books, reading news, typing two emails, and watching a couple of youtube videos. Still, that&#39;s an awesome battery life.In terms of Chrome OS, I think it has a perfect balance between simplicity and functionality. Sure, it can&#39;t run Photoshop or autoCAD, but I think the majority of people don&#39;t use those programs. I, personally, don&#39;t need anything more than what Chrome OS offers. If you really need some kind of editing tool, the Chrome Store has replacement apps that can get the job done. You just have to look for those apps or just Google search for them.Speed on this little guy is incredible! I can&#39;t believe that a $199 machine can work this quickly. Pages load up almost instantly and that includes videos. In terms of browser performance, the Acer beats my Windows laptop (which has a Core i7, 8gb ram, and a SSD). I don&#39;t know how Google accomplished this but it&#39;s truly incredible. I think the 4gb model is overkill. This 2gb model has not slowed on me. I use a max of about 10 tabs. The laptop never lags or skips a beat with that many open. I personally don&#39;t use more than that at any one time; however, I&#39;ve heard that this thing can handle up to 20 tabs without slowing down. I can&#39;t imagine how many you&#39;d need to open for the 4gb model to slow down.In general, this is a 5 star machine. If you&#39;re looking for a productivity machine that can entertain you during breaks, then look no further. This is the one!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Best laptop to stay productive!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401840000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

They&#39;re durable (very) and nice looking. The ear cushions are very comfortable, and for me, I can get a very good fit that remains comfortable for hours (I wear these for long as hell high school swim meets). The highs and mids are both good, especially compared to their SOL counterparts, and I feel they easily beat all those \&quot;mainstream headphones\&quot; out there: Beats, Monster DNAs, Soul,  Steet and Skullcandies. The bass is the strongest part, with equal emphasis on boom and tight thuds. We all know Beats and co, for instance, also have beefed up bass, so the reason SOL is better is actually because their MIDS are very competent. These cans are very capable of playing rock and metal (some examples of those two would be Shinedown, Breaking Benjamin, In Flames, and Soilwork). There is a sound separation I can note too, I feel like I can tell the various instrumentals apart. I dont want anyone comparing these to $300 Shures, of AKGS, or Sennheisers, because that&#39;s not they are for. On the other hand, I actually wasn&#39;t at all impressed by the $150 sennhesiers at Best Buy.Overall, these are well worth the money, and you can get them a little cheaper through Amazon. I would recommend testing the fit at a local store though, because the very nice headphone has a drawback: you cant adjust the angle the cans go on your ear, so people with stick-out ears may have a bigger issue. They work great for me, and my biggest criticism is the sound isolation is only average. There are a few cracks in the fit, which probably goes for everyone. Otherwise, they are stellar, and I have no problems with that single drawback.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;As good as casual headphones can be&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390953600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 29, 2014&quot;}</td>

The outer edges of the internal circle that is your onscreen view will be out of focus, but this is to be expected. The only major issue I have is that it can very difficult to properly focus your image (the iPhone doesn&#39;t help either with its automatic focusing).With that said, the little tripod is great for getting stabilized shots, and the 12X allows for picture capture that is really impressive, considering the whole thing costs $20. I also like this adapter over shooting images by holding the phone up to binoculars because it is a a whole lot easier AND the image encompasses the entire screen, while doing a shoot through a binocular phone setup will leave a black outer rim from where the binocular eye piece is.This thing is sturdy too and works as reported, but the optics are not the best thing out there, but you get what you pay for and this is a perfect find for $20.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Good buy for $20&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392681600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

The case is padded nicely, the black leather like exterior works nicely with the grey sueded interior.  The pad is unlined, but that&#39;s not an issue for me as I bought this with the intention of replacing the pad with an 8x5 pad (if you plan to do this, you will need a good sharp pair of scissors or a steady hand and a sharp razor to cut about a quarter of an inch off of each side of the cardboard on an 8x5 pad of paper...but it fills that side of the folio much better in my opinion than the non-standard funky sized pad they send in it).

I find myself using this mostly on my TV while watch previously recorded episodes of \&quot;The Blacklist\&quot; without waking up the whole house.In the hand the transmitter is very light, and smaller than a pack of \&quot;Tic-Tacs\&quot;. The design is very clean and makes using it a breeze. There is just one button, used for powering on/off and paring the device. A small LED light for status indication. The charging port blends in so well, you might overlook it. Last but not least, is the 3.5mm audio plug.Once you have found the audio source of your liking, just plug in the transmitter. Then put both the transmitter and Bluetooth headset into pairing mode. After they are connected, you can enjoy your favorite TV shows or music at your own volume without disturbing anyone else.Yes, this device has an internal batter that needs be charged. I get about nine hours of listening time before it goes dead. Attached to a USB port or wall charger, it takes 2 hours to fully charge. I know some people might object to having to always charge the device at the most inopportune time. I have found the perfect solution, while the transmitter is plugged into the TV, use one of the USB ports on the TV as a charging port. Now you can watch as much TV without having to ever disconnect the transmitter, it will stay charged.The best part is it can fit in your hand and be used on any headphone jack.Contents:iClever Bluetooth TransmitterUSB Charging CableUser ManualFEATURES:Bluetooth Version: 2.1 + A2DPOperating Rang: 33ft (10m)Audio Plug: 3.5mmCharging Time: 2 HoursPlaying Time: 9-10 HoursDimensions: 1.77 x 1.25 x 0.31in (45 x 32 x 8mm)Weight: 0.49oz (14g)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Listen To TV At Your Own Volume&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394064000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

I figured the OEM speakers could just handle the mid-bass and treble. The salesman thought I was crazy, but he and I liked the sound after installing the Bazooka. At the time, the salesman at the stereo shop talked me out of changing out the 4 OEM speakers, and I went with it. Never turned the bass on the head over 25% and adjusted the Bazooka accordingly. Over time I realized the treble had become a little harsh, but I lived with it. Truck got broken into in around 2008, all they took was the Bazooka tube. They would&#39;ve stole the head had I replaced it...learned that from a prior vehicle...don&#39;t replace the stereo, it invites thieves. Insurance company actually replaced the sub with a 250w Bazooka...more power!Now, many years later, 2014, I can tell that I blew at least the front passenger speaker, so time to swap em all out. Thought about a new head unit, but decided to try new speakers with the OEM head first. Picked up a pair of Polk Audio DB651 for the front doors, and a pair of these DB461P for the rear extended cab doors. Wow!!! I had almost never heard any sound coming out of my rear speakers til I installed these. Great highs and mids, and handle a lot more bass than the OEM&#39;s ever did. Now I run the OEM head at about 50% bass so I get more mid bass, still letting the Bazooka handle the low bass duties. These speakers all handle max volume of the head while remaining perfectly clear, listening to the heaviest of metal!!Installation was not all that difficult, had to remove all the door panels, plenty of YouTube vids explaining how to do that. Grabbed some of the Metra 72-4568 Speaker Harnesses for $6 a pair making the connections simple. Had to drill in to the inner steel of the door to mount them. Very thin steel there, so not a big deal. Couple hours invested and much better sound.I highly recommend them!!!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great Sound With OEM Radio&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396828800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

Jentsch&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;The first thing you&#39;ll notice about this keyboard cover is how nice the keyboard keys feel to the touch. I expected a compromised keyboard that had to sacrifice construction quality and key response in order to be light enough to serve as a cover for the iPad Air without adding so much to the bulk of the tablet as to make it something you wouldn&#39;t want to use very often.I was very wrong. I own a few other Logitech keyboards and this one can hold its own with them any day of the week.During use, the tablet rests comfortably in the slot, holding the tablet at a good angle for visibility. Tapping on the keys will not dislodge the iPad Air from that slot, which is a very good thing, as you really don&#39;t want an expensive tablet falling down and then bouncing from the table to the floor.Not only do you have a very nice Bluetooth keyboard, it also functions as a cover to protect the screen of the iPad Air. The tablet snaps into place quite well, and the weight and/or bulk that it adds does not make you wish that it was thinner or lighter.The only complaints that I had while using it leading up to this review are some quirks with the keystrokes and scrolling using the arrow keys. Copying and pasting with a keyboard is a lot easier than using your finger (in my opinion), so this was a joy to try out the first time.What I didn&#39;t expect was that the keystrokes for copy and paste do not mimic Windows, but rather the Mac. I guess that makes sense, given that the iPad is a cousin to the Mac, but would it have been so wrong to enable CTRL-C and CTRL-V as well as CMD-C and CMD-V? It didn&#39;t take me long to figure out what I was doing wrong, but others might not have experience with the Mac keystrokes and will end up confused. Even a note in the box mentioning it would have been a welcome touch.While in Safari, I expected the arrow keys to function like I am accustomed to them functioning in my web browsers on the desktop. I use my up and down arrow keys to scroll a page while I read (or the mouse scroll wheel, but no such thing on this keyboard), and I was surprised when hitting the down arrow key didn&#39;t scroll the document I was reading (maybe it&#39;s not the Mac way?).Aside from those two very minor issues, I can&#39;t think of anything wrong with this product. The price is a little high, but street prices fluctuate, so if that&#39;s a concern, keep an eye out for sales and price reductions and jump when you&#39;re comfortable.One side note, while I did the testing of fit and function with an iPad Air, I also tried out an iPad 4 to see if it would work. Electronically, it worked like a champ, which I expected it to. Unfortunately, the physical slot that holds the iPad is not made for the iPad 4, so while it will hold the tablet initially, it will not stay there, and you&#39;ll find yourself catching the tablet as it starts to lose its place and before it smacks the table or demonstrates the laws of gravity for you.I think you&#39;ll like this item, both as a keyboard and as a protective cover! Definitely recommended.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Very good quality construction, excellent keyboard feel&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389744000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

I ran the HDD cables under the HDD. I used Velcro tie strips in several places to gather the various cables into a harness of sorts.(6) I replaced the only fan with an Enermax UC-8EB fan which is very quiet and easy to clean.(7) The Blue LED on the front is bright. You&#39;re either going to like it or not like it.(8) If you&#39;re looking for front USB 3.0 ports, this is not the case for you (look for the BP655.300BL &amp; check with the seller since some sellers are taking this case &amp; just upgrading the PSU. The ports on the front should be blue for USB 3.0(9) There is no chassis speaker. The motherboard that I used had a 4-pin speaker header and I was able to purchase a small 2-wire speaker on a 4-pin header for a couple of bucks. The speaker is mostly for POST errors.I built two nearly identical systems using the MSI FM2-75IA-E53 motherboard which has rear USB 3.0 ports as well as built-in Wi-Fi.

I&#39;ve purchased several different types of cloths, wet cleaning wipes and sprays to help and while they do work for a little while they can push oils and dirt into the hardware on the glasses which you just can&#39;t get to.  I purchased this to help with that problem, and so far so good.It works.  It&#39;s a little bit of a process (add warm water, add some of the provided cleaning fluid and add 2 drops of Dawn dish washing liquid), put glasses/whatever into the basket, let it run, dry, maybe run again if you need to.  I run my glasses through twice, especially if there are pressed-on fingerprints which do not come off the first time, ever.  I&#39;ve tested different levels of filth on them and I still prefer to run them through once, dry them off with a cleaning cloth and then run them through again.  Results are better, of course, if you wipe them off first as well.For other jewelry I&#39;ve had limited experience but it has worked well for them also.  Note that you should not put in your watch unless it&#39;s waterPROOF (NOT water resistant) and if it has no damage.Overall a decent purchase.-D&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Good for glasses and jewelry - better than dry cloths at least.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393200000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 24, 2014&quot;}</td>

If I&#39;m on vacation I prefer to wear it on the belt. If I&#39;m grabbing the camera for a quick run somewhere I use the shoulder strap. I would definitely recommend it to someone else.

I also own a D5100. I&#39;m not going to go into details why I think it is an awesome DSLR because someone else probably already stated all those reasons. I didn&#39;t buy the D7100 hoping for better image quality vs the D5100. Both have similiar image quality and impossible to tell apart. Some said, the D7100&#39;s high ISO performance isn&#39;t that great vs the D5100. It&#39;s actually slightly better, but not by much according to my tests. Keep in mind you&#39;re viewing a 24mp vs 16mp too.Tested the D610 before making my choice to go with the D7100. The D610 isn&#39;t a  bad camera, but can&#39;t stand all the focus points cluttered into a tight space. The D7100 also seem to focus faster too with the same lens (50mm F/1.8).  If i were to go full frame, i would skip directly to the D800&#39;s. Personally I think the D7100 is better than the D610 and D700. I do mostly daylight photography, so paying extra $$$ for low light performance isn&#39;t worth it and it&#39;s not like the D7100 sucks in low light anyway. I get usable/good pictures up to ISO 3200.Only a few thing I don&#39;t quite like about this DSLR.****The ISO button cannot be programmed to another button. when using a light lens, it&#39;s not so bad, but when using a heavy lens like the 70-200 F/2.8, it&#39;s tough.EDIT: 4/9/14 &amp;lt;Dropped 5 stars to 4&gt;After 1000 shots, about 20-30 small spots appeared across the whole frame at F22. I almost never shoot pass F8 (portrait photographer only), but this sort of bothers me. My D5100 doesn&#39;t have this problem after 6000 shots. Please comment if you have this problem too.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Awesome DSLR&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389398400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 11, 2014&quot;}</td>

Minor cosmetic imperfection on top or sides of one or more of the speakers.\&quot;  The imperfection was not horrible and did not impair its functionality at all. I was able to gently manipulate the metal corner back a little to make it less imperfect.As far as the actual sound, and functionality, its okay.  I took a star off because I am glad I paid half the price, I feel thats more realistic.  I&#39;ve heard other brands, and this appears to be average.  I did the 2.2 firmware update, and changed the voice to something else.  Otherwise, for the going \&quot;new\&quot; amount, I&#39;d really consider doing what I did, look for used/refurb.Paired quickly, about 20 seconds or less, audible voice tells you, a little annoying at the office, but my coworkers don&#39;t really care.Volume controls are simple and I can also have some control from the iPhone.  In the new firmware 2.2 update you get a live audio feature (hold both volume controls). I can&#39;t really tell much of a diff, but I am in the office at the moment.I did crank it up, and it didn&#39;t have that room filling warmth like the other \&quot;B\&quot; brand out there.As I said, for the price I paid, its worth it.  I am happy with it.**Update**I took a star away due to its lack luster performance.  I was happy with it, as a work speaker pushing a very low volume.  I used it in the car, volume all the way up, and live audio off.  It was what I&#39;d consider barely acceptable.  In the kitchen all the way up, I found it to be ok.  I don&#39;t get the hype.  Its really mediocre, for even what I paid.  I don&#39;t recommend it for anyone who wants room filling sound beyond. To those who think its awesome needs to check out the other brands.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Half off price!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393545600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 28, 2014&quot;}</td>

One was configured as an Access Point. I have to admit that they perform extremely well when they fully work. But they wont last long. Within a year, I did 3 RMAs to Asus service center. One was replaced twice, another one was replace once. The first  RMA was created at eighth month because the router was suddenly dead. The second RMA was created at tenth month because the replaced router wifi problems. Basically, I could access internet via wire connection to the router but could not wirelessly access internet although all devices showed wifi connection. The third RMA was created at tenth month because the 5Ghz band of other router randomly worked and 2.4Ghz band totally disappeared.Note: Although Asus customer service is not bad but the RMA shipping is paid from your own pocket. To RMA, you need to work with them to solve the problem. If they give up, they will authorize you to RMA. The replacement will be a REFURBISHED/RECERTIFIED one, not NEW. Also, your network will be disable/cripple during RMA process which is about 10 days to 14 days.Suggestion: As long as the router functions well in your network, ignore the new firmware. Upgrading new firmware will cause a new problem.GOOD LUCK.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Very good performance, but absolutely UNRELIABLE&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394668800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 13, 2014&quot;}</td>

The case literally makes my ipad air feel like it is completely protected. What I especially love is the fact that the case also covers your SCREEN (plastic shield).  So, I will NEVER scratch my ipad screen. I was surprised at how response the plastic cover over the ipad air screen would be. I had been buying the cheap plastic covers to go on my screen, but I do not need to do that with this case. It truly does protect every single side of my ipad air.The handle on the back is great! I first thought to myself, \&quot;boy, this handle looks stupid. What is it for?\&quot; But, after using my ipad air to read kindle and other electronic books, I can say that having the handle on my hand allows me to REST so my the strain of holding my ipad is gone! The fact that I can rotate the handle is perfect for folks who read electronic books.I&#39;m also a speed walker. I walked 30 minutes fast pace with nothing but my hand in the handle of the ipad case and my ipad did not fall, nor did I even think it would fall. It truly makes the ipad feel secure.NEGATIVES:Because the case surrounds the bezel, it is almost impossible to relocate icons in landscape view. Go ahead. Try it! Hold down one of your icons in landscape view to the point where all of the icons shake, which signals that you can now move them on different screens... Now, try to move one icon on one screen to another screen in landscape mode/view. You can&#39;t because the trent case covers up so much of your ipad&#39;s bezel that you have to rotate your ipad air back into portrait view to move your icons to other screens. Maybe it&#39;s just MY case.  But, I cannot do it in landscape view at all!The instructions should be in color or should be a photo of the actual case. I first had the hardest time getting the case open to place my ipad in it because I couldn&#39;t figure out where along the edges, I was suppose to open the case.  I kept pulling and pulling and then thinking, maybe this isn&#39;t the right spot because the case won&#39;t open.  I wish I could see a better image on the instruction sheet.  It turns out it was the right spot, but the case is a bear to open up!  You will think you&#39;re going to break it to get it open.  Perhaps the areas to open the case should have been a different color, rather than the same color as the case.  Additionally, once I finally got the case open and placed my ipad air in it and snapped it back shut, I then read the NEXT line of instructions. The next line talked about how I could adjust the strap for my hand.Well, guess what? The strap was too large for my hand, so I had to RE-OPEN the case and REMOVE my ipad air. Then, because the straps are so secure on the little screws to adjust it, I had to use a great deal of strenght to remove the strap to tighten it up. I felt like I was going ot break the strap. By the time I repositioned the strap and placed my ipad air back in the case, I had several finger prints and smudges INSIDE the case and on my ipad, so I had to clean it with a soft rag before placing it back in the case again.I guess my point is, the instructions for adjusting the hand strap should be the FIRST thing mentioned. Otherwise, you&#39;re going to have folks placing their ipad in the case, securing it and THEN reading about adjusting the strap and they will have to RE-OPEN  the case all over again. The strap is automatically adjusted for the largest hands. Why? Perhaps it should be adjusted just one notch down for those who have average sized hands.It&#39;s because of these two issues that I reduced it to 4 stars, rather than rate it at 5.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;This baby TRULY protects your ipad. Wow!  1 star off for difficulty assembly though&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394236800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

Of course. You already knew this. The shallow depth-of-field you can get with this is amazing, with the full-frame sensor, at maximum aperture. (Well technically, the sensor doesn&#39;t produce shallow depth of field, the lens focal length does. And at the same distance and framing, a larger sensor requires a longer focal length [shorter depth-of-field] than a smaller one. It&#39;s all interrelated.)- Love all the customizable buttons.- I can&#39;t get over the size of this thing. It&#39;s so small (yet useable). If you were to remove the battery grip, the swivel mechanism for the LCD monitor, and the viewfinder - this thing would fit in any pocket. (Well minus the lens.)- Multiple pro photography websites call this sensor the best currently in the world, or very close to it. The 55mm f/1.8 prime lens has been tested as the second-best lens ever tested by some magazine. (Behind a Leica lens.)- The idea of apps is pretty cool.- It has a really cool single-shot HDR-like feature (forgetting the name). Basically it takes a darker image than you chose, then brings up the shadows while leaving the highlights the same. I&#39;ve used this exact same method for over a decade - I adjust exposure compensation down a couple of clicks, then bring the shadows up in post. This helps prevent blown-out highlights, and assuming your ISO is low enough, doesn&#39;t increase shadow noise much (because the camera can choose a lower ISO than you would use otherwise). The only drawback is that if you dial this effect up too much, the images look a little flat. There isn&#39;t as much contrast to pop. And there seems to be a slight &amp;#34;HDR&amp;#34;-ish local contrast effect. Not as obvious as HDR mode, but it I think it&#39;s there.- Focus peaking feature is awesome, even in the mostly auto-focus mode that also uses it.- Manual focusing is easy with automatic &amp;#34;pixel zoom&amp;#34; and focus peaking.- The continuous focus mode is really cool. You can focus and recompose, and watch the focus box follow what you originally focused on. (How do they do that! That&#39;s like machine vision. In a camera.)PSEUDO-CONS- Viewfinder isn&#39;t very good. Not high-res enough. But...what do you expect? You are buying a mirrorless camera! It&#39;s not an SLR.- The kit lens isn&#39;t amazing. Better than I feared, worse than I hoped. Will definitely invest in a more expensive lens.- The HDR feature does too much &amp;#34;local contrast&amp;#34; and looks too flat/&amp;#34;HDR-ey&amp;#34;. It would have been nice if there were a menu option letting you specify how to present the dynamic range. Specifically, instead of contrast masking with overdone local contrast, I&#39;d rather it collapsed the dynamic range. And better yet, collapsed the dynamic range with more than 8 bits per color of JPEG; i.e., collapsed dynamic range with 16 bits-per-color raw. (Or even the native 14 bpc. You might think that 14 bpc only contains 75% more data than 8 bpc. You&#39;d be wrong, it&#39;s actually 6,400% times more information.) But, sometimes it works pretty well.- Why doesn&#39;t focus peaking work in full auto-focus mode? It would be really nice to see what the autofocuser has decided will be in focus, above and beyond the crude green brackets/squares.CONS (-1 star for these)- Startup is too slow. Not intolerable, just too slow for a camera this expensive.- They give you two customizable dial positions that you can program however you want. That&#39;s great - Canon doesn&#39;t have that. But I need more!- Vignetting is quite noticeable at wide aperture, even in JPEG mode with automatic lens correction. At f/8.0 though, it goes away. But still - one of the main points of a full-frame sensor is getting that beautiful DOF, which means using wide aperture.- Camera has &amp;#34;auto ISO&amp;#34; setting, BUT NO MINIMUM SHUTTER SPEED SETTING! What the heck? Well actually it does - the minimum is 1/60. But it&#39;s not user-adjustable. 1/60 is not fast enough for longer focal lengths. Waiting for a firmware upgrade.- Sucker is LOUD. You&#39;d think that with no mirror to flop out of the way, it would be whisper-quiet. Nope. Loud as heck. Somewhat satisfying, but still loud.CAN&#39;T COMMENTI haven&#39;t done long exposures yet - which is something I like to do. Also haven&#39;t done timelapse video, something else I like to do.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A revelation. But with some mildly frustrating quirks - that you&#39;ll learn to live with or work around. Get this camera.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404604800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

I have tried both the clear and the matte screen protectors on all four devices.  As far as brands go, this is one of the better ones.  There are still problems getting these screen protectors on without bubbles and especially little micro fibers getting underneath during the process.  This is not the manufacturers fault but it is still irritating.  I usually end up using two to three screen protectors each time before I can get them right, and obviously I have done this a few times.  There videos are great, but you still have to do it a few times before you can get it right.  The tape that they include is okay, but kind of useless because it is so small.  With my fat fingers, I usually put more prints on the screen rather than picking up the micro fibers.  A bigger piece of tape would be nice.Now on to the actual product review.  Like I said, I have tried both the clear and the matte finishes on both the 5th gen iPod touch with retina and the 1st gen iPad Mini without retina.  The clear screen protectors give you the best picture, but picks up fingerprints and glare just as bad as the screen without anything.  The matte screen protector does a good job against glare, but it does mess with the retina display pretty bad, and is still not all that great even without the retina.  Also, the matte does not pick up fingerprints, but what is does is it gets cloudy from the skin off your fingers which can end up making your screen look cloudy, and it is tougher to wipe off than the clear screen protectors.Overall, in my opinion, they are both decent products, but not great as they both have their shortcomings.  I think maybe what I will try next is the Ballistic Glass that Tech Armor offers.  Unfortunately it is much more expensive, like $30 each instead of $7 for three.  Maybe some time in the future I will splurge.  I still think Tech Armor is among the best out there though.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Undecided whether to buy again or not.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389312000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 10, 2014&quot;}</td>

It definitely has that cheap plastic feel to it, but I&#39;m not taking a star off for this since it was expected and not marketed as a tough drive or anything. The slide mechanism locks properly and hasn&#39;t caused me any issues. The size is perfect for a small pouch or coin purse and won&#39;t feel bulky in a pocket.

It changes the functions of some of the keys. It seems to work well.* The 4 LED lights are nice (well designed). The power LED will go off after 4 seconds, probably to save power.* It includes 4 rubber (or rubber like) feet to stick on the bottom of the keyboard. I wish it included more as I put one in each corner but it flexes a bit in the middle if you press hard enough. It would have been nice to put at least one rubber foot in the middle... but this is really no big deal.* It comes with a nice felt (or felt-like) carrying bag.* I tested it with my Dell Venue 8 Pro (Windows 8.1) and an Andoid smartphone and had no issues.* Claims an uninterrupted working time of about 100 hours and a standby time of over 100 days.I can&#39;t really find anything negative to say about this keyboard except for the minor quibble about wanting more rubber feet... so I&#39;m giving it 5 stars.

I&#39;m currently awaiting a replacement because, even though I was careful, somehow my tripod mount screw at the bottom has become stripped already and the camera falls right off the tripod....The camera shoots amazing videos and takes amazing photos for a point and shoot and the built-in wifi has been fantastic, especially for taking pictures of you and buddies from a distance at points of interest along hikes.My gripes about the camera are:battery is horrible in cold temperatures. Like really I couldn&#39;t even shoot a 15 minute video without have to use a spare battery. (i now have 6 batteries for the camera)the zoom isn&#39;t all the goodThe screw in port for the tripod is plastic, who does that.If you are going to be hooking this up to a tripod a lot consider a different camera or go ahead and purchase a repair kit and a few extra batteries with your first order..EDIT: Actually this will fix the tripod screw issue [...]&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Good camera but issues&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390867200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 28, 2014&quot;}</td>

I think they are a necessary evil for devices that will be used outdoors like phones with touchscreens and GPS&#39;s.  Thankfully you are provided with 3 sheets of the plastic film and some high quality adhesive sheets to pick up the tiny specs of lint that will stick to your freshly cleaned screen.  I threw away the first sheet after peeling it off when trying to remove its top protective layer after installing it on my phone.  The second time around, I got the sheet installed and the protective layer removed while keeping the sheet in place.  The installation wasn&#39;t perfect, however.  There were a couple tiny specks of lint that got between the screen and the sheet, but they are at the bottom edge and not worth messing with.If you&#39;re as anal as I am, you will have some trouble trying to put this on your phone centered and square.  I could not get the cutout for the phone&#39;s home button centered vertically but if you could do that, the sheet would fit perfectly. The top cutout for the earpiece, camera and sensors will not interfere with their functions.  The plastic seems to be tough and hasn&#39;t been scratched yet and is easy to clean without delaminating.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Works well, a pain to put on cleanly&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395446400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 22, 2014&quot;}</td>

The strap is adjustable for length and has some sliding stops on it to hopefully keep your camera &amp;#34;holstered&amp;#34; at a repeatable position and the padding of the strap on your sholder.The issue I had with it was the mounting plate and captive screw.  When I screwed it into the bottom of my Nikon the plate was still spinning freely and not snugged up to the bottom of the camera as I&#39;d expected.  In one respect this could keep camera motion from unscrewing the screw and dropping your camera but the plate rattling around was disconcerting for me.I ended up keeping the strap and and am now trying two different screws (from Amazon) to see which I prefer, they are the Fotasy NSQS and EzFoto stainless steel screw.  I&#39;m also making a bare nylon strap (no storage) to try out with these mounts also.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The strap is pretty decent but I have an issue with the mount.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391904000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

Mccleary&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [2, 3], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;I&#39;ve had this receiver for about 6 months now, and it&#39;s still working fine.  Tonight I did a firmware update, which reminded me that I haven&#39;t reviewed it yet.Things I&#39;ve noticed:1.  There&#39;s a bunch of buttons near the top of the remote for selecting which input you&#39;re using.  On the left side of the remote is a button marked &amp;#34;receiver&amp;#34;.  In order to do anything on the receiver, you need to press the receiver button so that the remote knows to send signals to the receiver.  It seems silly, but I spend an awfully long time trying to figure out why I couldn&#39;t get the on screen menu to respond.PROs:1.  6 HDMI inputs. Granted I&#39;m only using one input to feed signals from a Home Theatre PC, but it&#39;s good to have expandabiltiy.2.  Self measuring room equalization.  This required a little tweaking of levels when it was done, but that&#39;s pretty normal.  I&#39;m pretty particular about matching levels between the speakers and the subwoofer.3.  Plenty of power for the speakers.  Since I have a powered subwoofer, the 5 highpass speakers got plenty of power.  If you&#39;re not running a subwoofer, you might have issues with bass sounds clipping the amp.4.  The remote works quite well, with a pretty good layout. I&#39;ve programmed the orange button in the middle of the left side to power on/off the ceiling mounted projector.CONS:1.  Other reviewers have written at length about how Zone 2 can only user certain types of input source material.2.  Various clicks/thumps/delays when switching sources.3.  Firmware updates don&#39;t work over wifi, only by wired ethernet or USB stick.As you can tell, I don&#39;t really have much negative to say about it... it works for controlling the volume, powers my speakers, flattens out the room response curve, and just plain works.  I wouldn&#39;t pay full price for it, but at about half the listed price (as it was recently listed on a wooty site), it&#39;s a steal.  Now that I know it&#39;s quirks, I&#39;m quite pleased with it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Works great, love having a phono input&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1388707200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

That said the reason this only got 3 stars is that one battery started leaking after 3 charges so I tossed the set as I only use 4 at a time and when one cell goes bad I don&#39;t like to mix up batteries that were purchased at different times.

Slight distortion at high levels, but great lows and mids at any volume. They can get painfully loud without sounding awful, but they do leave you kind of wanting in the base department.

As a prime account user, it arrived exactly on time. Setup and installation was easy and quick. However, after charging the unit, and preparing to wear the new phones, while watching a TV program, I immediately noticed that by moving my head, nodding my head, making any movement whatsoever would cause the earphones to turn off.  I then decided to move the base stations to a  different area making sure there was nothing between the base station and the earphones.  This did not eliminate the problem. And then, the phones began giving off a low hissing sound.  I tried the phones for three different nights.  Same thing every night.For the money these phones cost they are not worth the problems. They are being returned to Amazon.  My three year old pair of TV Ears is better than these ear phones, at much less the cost.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Not worth the cost.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400457600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 19, 2014&quot;}</td>

Cheaper battery-powered headphone amps are available, but the specs and features of the ART HeadAmp4 made the difference for me, the higher price notwithstanding.There are four separate outputs (and four separate volume controls), making the amp a splitter as well.  It&#39;s powered by a small wall transformer instead of batteries.  The case is extruded aluminum, not plastic, and it has rubber feet that won&#39;t scratch furniture.Sound is very clear and there is plenty of amplification for any type of headphone.The amplifier will work with any headphone level output.  That is, you could use it with any computer, video game, TV, radio, MP3 player or other device with a headphone jack.You do need a cable with a 1/8&amp;#34; (3.5mm) male stereo plug on each end.  This is not supplied with the amp, but is available from Amazon or other vendors.My only minor gripe is that there is no power switch, so you have to unplug the wall transformer to turn it off.  I plugged the wall transformer into a small switched plug strip which works fine but does add yet another cord to our increasingly tangled TV/audio setup.Overall, we&#39;re very pleased with this high quality unit.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;High quality headphone amp for a multitude of applications&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392422400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

Deep groves, rotating iPad, great padding, snap-in plastic cover, can&#39;t ask for better protection.  Except the magnet is poorly designed.  It works - but the cover is too stiff - it keeps turning the ipad on and off because it never gets that perfect contact.Before this case, I kept my iPad in Targus Vuscape for about 2 years - it was a good case - 4/5, but magnet was perfect. That case had another problem - the grooves were shallow and iPad constantly slipped out.  Honestly, finding that perfect case seems impossible.Right now, I&#39;m keeping Versavu and I turned off iPad magnet lock.  I put on 5min auto-lock and just close the cover and let iPad self-lock in 5min.

The fact you cant ADD or remove most pages or is an issue maybe, but with a little common sense by cutting where the rings go and moving the page then re-taping where the rings hold the page, it works fine that way but Ive only moved a couple pages but no problems.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;overall&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">5.0</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;summary&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Very nice DVD holder<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;unixReviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">1393286400</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;reviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>02 25, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

Pleasantly surprised, this Fosmon (never heard of the company before) case improves the overall look the my Nexus 7 FHD.One thing to note, this will ONLY FIT THE 2013 NEXUS 7.Cut outs are spot on. No port is obstructed, no speaker is covered up, and unlike some other cases I&#39;ve used, the headphone jack isn&#39;t overprotected, so larger 3.5mm cased headphone plugs won&#39;t have much trouble with fitment, as well as the micro USB port.Power button as well as the volume rocker are covered up, allowing easy to find embossed locations.Construction feels very sturdy. It was a tight fit getting it on properly, but the end result makes it feel like part of the tabet. It really does feel like it will provide ample protection against dings and short falls. I particularly like the clear bezel and frosted back. It makes the Nexus 7 look much more modern and classy. It&#39;s also cool being able to see the &amp;#34;nexus&amp;#34; logo through the case. The back of the case (frosted portion, which is the entire back), is a little slippery, but not enough that it would slide on a whim.If you do have a front screen shield (mine in particular is from Bodyguardz), you&#39;ll be happy to know this case is a perfect companion for it. It seems like the measurement of the screen guard matches perfectly to where the outer bezel of the case ends. I also had a back protector too and thought I could get away with leaving it on, but it just wouldn&#39;t work; the case fits so snug, that it wouldn&#39;t fit properly with that less than .04 mm thick shield on.Overall, loving this case!

So cool to be 50&#39; away, totally out of line of sight, with a couple of walls in the way- one concrete block, and it works like a charm. I have an extra TV hooked to my DVR, used to have to walk to the main room to fast forward past the commercials/change channels, now I can do it remotely.  My only complaints: the battery comes out of the charger only at about 1.4 volts (instead of 1.5+), so I have to swap the battery with the one that has been charged about once a month (you get two), and the little IR emitter that you have to position over the receivers sensor didn&#39;t stick well- had to use a little tape to hold it.For those who found the description a little confusing in the listing on Amazon here is how it works.  They give you a mini battery and transmitter that will replace either a AA or AAA battery in your remote control.  When you use your remote, the transmitter (which is now in your remote&#39;s battery compartment) sends a signal to the quite small flying saucer looking thing which you put by the item you want to control.  The saucer converts the radio signal to Infra Red which by way of the emitter (with a nice long wire for convenience) that you stick over the IR window on the controlled device.

The Data migration software did not recognize the OS partition on the internal hard disk, which is dynamic, not basic. So I used the EaseUS Partition Master Free software to migrate the data. It took 3 reboots for the 3 partitions on my Asus N53SV-X1 quad-core (2630QM@ 2gHz) laptop, but worked flawlessly. That software also lets you optimize the migration for SSDs.2. The boot time for the basic machine with nothing connected dropped from 2:27 to 0:27. I can live with that. With all my junk hooked to the computer, external keyboard, trackball, 3 extra HD monitors on USB video cards, plus a Magic Jack Plus USB which has a long driver install routine, the boot time went from 3:05 to 0:45. Slower, but that&#39;s a real world number.3. As others have mentioned, everything is snappier, including web browsing, Large file loading/parsing for video editing has improved about 100%.4. I also went from 4gB to 8gB of RAM and re-tested. No real speed difference, though it will be handy for editing.Conclusion: Get an SSD before you increase RAM, unless you have some really pressing need for RAM. (I&#39;m not a gamer.) This laptop, late 2011 vintage, was not slow, but is now very noticeably quicker, to the point where upgrading to faster laptop is pushed back for me. The OEM drive was a 512 GB 7200 RPM Seagate Momentus, which, like the WD Black series I&#39;ve used, is pretty fast. The 840 Pro puts them both in the weeds.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Serious performance improvement on a quad-core laptop.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404864000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

Had I a choice, I would have selected black because the white shows dirt way to easily.  Not usually an issue unless the device is meant to be portable and used all over the place (which is how I use it).Overall, I really enjoy the functionality and the sound from this speaker.  As spring is just kicking off, I&#39;ve been using this speaker outside as I&#39;ve have been doing work around the house.  It sounds incredible at mid to really loud levels.  An amusing side story..  I was testing the speaker outside on a nice sunny day and got into a discussion about hawks and eagles with a friend.  I have an Audubon Birds app on my phone, so I was playing the sound of hawks very loudly through the speaker.  After that, we looked up and there was a single bird moving or flying in any of the trees in my back yard. At all.  A testament to the quality and volume of sound for this speaker.Even at low volumes I did not have any issues with this speaker.  The sound was clear and smooth.  Possibly not as crisp as it could have been, still very good.There are some concerns I have with the speaker...- Buttons - wish there was more tactical feel for a button press.  Since there is a slight delay in the response to the volume buttons, it can be annoying to use the buttons.- DLNA - Configuring the DLNA was not intuitive.  I am still not sure if I got it working right.  Airplay and Bluetooth were easy.  I usually focus on Bluetooth anyway.- iPhone App - the App looked nice (turns out, like lipstick on a pig), but using it was non-intuitive and a PAIN in the butt.  SPEND MORE TIME ON DEVELOPING YOUR APPS!  This is a common problem.  Companies spend all their time developing their cool product and then do a phone app as an afterthought.  Since this device can do all kinds of things beyond the buttons on the device... your app suddenly becomes your primary interface to the device.  Treat the app that way.  (-1 star)Price... I think if HK wants to product to take off, the price will need to come down.  Truly I like the product... have enjoyed using it and look forward to using it.  Still..  I doubt I&#39;d purchase it at the current price.Overall... as a product, love my HK portable speaker.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great speaker to do projects with&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398556800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 27, 2014&quot;}</td>

The item arrived and I&#39;ve used it once now to burn music from my computer to a CD. The drive worked as advertised. It is a great buy for the money but I have to caution that the cord that connects the drive to your PC is ridiculously small! I read this complaint about the product in a number of reviews before purchasing but decided anyway to get it; thought those that bought the product were maybe overreacting about the cord?  It turns out they weren&#39;t, so word of advice: believe what you read in the reviews! I am not lying when I tell you this cord is roughly 1-2 inches in length and that is all!  I have body parts a lot larger than this cord that are attached to me! Are you one that believes that it&#39;s not the size that matters but how you use it? If so, I would recommend purchasing this product then! Good luck! I hope you found this review humorous and helpful.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;This is a good value for the money!

I don&#39;t lug a tripod around, so I was very excited to try this monopod.Amazon&#39;s no fuss packaging was great, and I like that it comes in a snug zipper bag with a shoulder carry strap. The mechanisms for extending the length worked smoothly and locked with a solid feel. The pole isn&#39;t bulky and it&#39;s lightweight enough to carry around in the bag or carry as a walking stick. The handle is a good size and has a nice amount of padding.I tried it with my little point and shoot and with my DSLR and both felt secure. I think I could actually walk around with the compact camera attached, but the DSLR was heavy enough that I would want to unscrew it when not in use. When the camera is attached you&#39;re basically locked into a landscape shot, but I found that in a pinch I could brace the end against a wall, or the pole under my arm for a portrait shot if needed.At this price point, it&#39;s an easy purchase to add some stability to your shots when it&#39;s needed.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Basic can be Good&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392940800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 21, 2014&quot;}</td>

Just like with HM700/RE-400B, a lot of attention was paid to presentation of the product to the point where they actually had to include the storage hard zippered case with extra eartips in a separate bag so it doesn&#39;t interfere with a slim profile of the original RE-400 package. The headphones were sitting inside of a felt lined foam insert with cutouts for extra eartips. Furthermore, more eartips were included with a storage case. When it comes to accessories, HiFiMAN never disappoints. In addition to headphones and storage case, they included 3 pairs of bi-flange eartips, 2 pairs of smaller black silicon tips, 3 custom shape clear silicone tips, 2 pairs of T-400 Comply premium foam tips (large and medium size), 5 pairs of filters, and a shirt clip. Though I can tell you ahead these headphones sound amazing, the right selection of eartips is VERY important to bring out the best in sound and isolation. I have a rather large ear canal and always use the largest included tip, where the custom shaped clear one provided the best passive noise isolation I ever experienced with any of in-ears.The first thing you notice when you take these headphones out - how super lightweight and compact they are. The barrel of these earpieces is made out of lightweight aluminum material and has a great ergonomics to fit comfortably inside of your ear. The barrel opening is covered by a cloth material filter (5 replacement pairs included), and right next to the strain relief there is a pinhole port for sound shaping. Followed by a decent strain relief the cables use a durable shiny rubber coating up until the y-splitter. Included chin slider moves very smoothly and made out of the same aluminum material. After y-splitter, the cable has a &amp;#34;shoe lace&amp;#34; type of cloth material cover which is still very durable and doesn&#39;t have that annoying springy effect found with so many other cables. The cable is terminated by a gold plated 3.5mm angled connector with a flexible strain relief. I also noticed microphonics effect was down to minimum.When it comes to sound quality, RE-400 delivers amazing results! This single dynamic driver in-ear really focuses to deliver a neutral transparent sound but unlike other neutral headphones that sound lifeless - these are very smooth and warm. The sound is not in your face, it&#39;s a few steps back, but it sounds very natural without any artificial enhancement. The characteristics that surprised me the most was the low end where neutral headphones usually try hard to show details but lack the extension. Here, you still get a very detailed bass sound without any humps, but it actually extends beyond mid-bass punch down to some sub-bass texture. It&#39;s not enhanced or boosted, just perfect to enjoy your low frequencies, well controlled without spilling into mids. I found bass to be not as fast in comparison to my other headphones, but it&#39;s very well rounded and full. Mids are very detailed, clear, maybe a bit forward but not too much. The vocals sound very natural and lush. High frequency (treble) is extended, detailed, bright but not harsh and without any hint of sibilance. Upper mids/treble is very well controlled and just perfect for extended listening period without ear fatigue. The soundstage is average, not too wide which was definitely a step back from RE-400B balanced version that had an amazing 3D width. But this is in-line with other similar IEMs, while balanced wiring/architecture is intended to widen the sound. The headphones were really easy to drive from my phone and X5, but I did notice I had to dial in a higher volume level to enjoy them more.Overall, I knew that I will not be disappointed with RE-400, and my testing just solidified that! No matter what genre of music you are listening to, these headphones will guarantee to bring out the best in every song. The sound has just a perfect balance of neutral natural tones without going into any extreme. Perhaps if you are a basshead craving for a more bass impact or need an analytical bright set of headphones - these might not be your cup of tea. But as all around headphones that sounds and looks great, and has a very reasonable pricing in comparison to other single and multi-driver IEMs in the sound sound category - these deserve a serious consideration.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Amazing sound quality!!!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399766400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 11, 2014&quot;}</td>

In previous models of computers I&#39;ve owned, I missed out on the 10-key pad on the side - glad to have that back! This one has something I&#39;ve never had before: a feature where it monitors the hard drive for shocks and deactivates it, even if only temporarily, to prevent damage to the data on the drive if the computer is severely bumped or if it falls down!It also came with very little &amp;#34;bloat ware,&amp;#34; in other words, the annoying software that is loaded onto new computers that only have 30, 60, or 90 day trials, and then you have to pay for the full version, or delete it. I love that too!The computer is fast with the amount of memory it came with (4GB,) but expandable up to 16 GB! Great if you like gaming! (Very easy to do on a laptop, too!) The AMD A6 5350M APU Dual-Core 2.9 GHz also included makes for a great experience if you want a computer that doesn&#39;t lag along at a snail&#39;s pace, lol!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;VERY nice computer!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401753600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

Huh?! but I just used it last night and it worked fine. I did an extensive investigation on the internet, tried the DISKPART utility, tried low level formatting, tried changing permissions, even, with my heart palpitating in apprehension, tried modifying the registry. All to no avail. Even more weirdly I can&#39;t even make a proper backup of what is on the disk - I can read and copy some of the folders, the others I can&#39;t copy to my laptop hard drive. The general consensus on the internetz seems to be that this is caused by a bug in the software and there is no option other than to return it for a replacement. Of course, Amazon does not issues RMA for this item after a one month window, which means that I have to bear the loss.

The remote is also handy in case you need to switch signals.My Roku is on all the time so I leave it on the 3rd switch port.I use an HDMI cable saver (8&amp;#34; HDMI M-F) on the TV&#39;s second HDMI port just in case I want to watch one source while I am recording another. In that case I remove the source signal I want to watch from the switch and plug it into the cable saver directly on the TV.My only complaint is regarding the brightness of the 3 blue LEDs.  Not that I would deduct a star over it, but it can be annoying.Orientation of the unit, or using tape to mask the LEDs, are options.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;very happy with switch&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394841600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

I am often in harsh conditions and like to have my iPad with me because I keep almost everything I need during the day on it.  While I take very good care of my equipment, I need to be confident that I am not going to damage my expensive electronics.What this case is not &amp;#8212; it is not waterproof, it is water resistant.  I have had a number of so called waterproof cases, and they all have failed at some point.  I prefer the water resistant cases as they do not give you a false sense that you are protected.  The front of this case is pretty well sealed, but the back does have some open places water can enter.  I feel confident it will protect against light rain and spray, which will account for 99% of the environment where one would try to use an iPad.What this case is - expendable.  When you think about the money invested in an iPad, you want to ensure it lasts.  This case will eventually wear out, get dropped, have the face significant scratched, etc - and that is exactly what you want to happen.  Given this case costs less than 5% of my iPad, let it takes the falls and protect your precious investment.Now on the the good and not as good &amp;#8212;Good - The case seems well protected and durable.  The outer rubber shell is stiff and feels very durable.  It is a smoother type rubber, not the &amp;#8220;sticky&amp;#8221; rubber that attracts lint and dirt.  The home button is well protected and has a very solid feel underneath the protective case.  All of the ports are still accessible, including the charge port - which is often too small for some aftermarket charge cords, but not in this case.  The protective screen is solid and clear, it shows no signs of bubbling underneath.  I like the case stand - it is metal and is very sturdy to hold up the device.Not as good - two concerns with the leather strap.  First of all, it is difficult to adjust to a smaller size.  Second, as I got the leather strap wet it held water for quite some time.  While it looks very nice and feels rugged, I am not sure it would not be better with some other type of syntactic material.Neither good nor bad - just part of having a case.  This is not a case you will want to take your iPad in and out of often.  Once it goes in, you will want to leave it is not easy removing and will weaken the case over time.  You also have to get used to the protective screen surface.  it is slightly less &amp;#8220;smooth&amp;#8221; when using, but typical of all screen protectors and still very usable.Overall I would recommend.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Good protection / great price value&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395360000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 21, 2014&quot;}</td>

No not this style but most likely another Case Logic.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;This is a very nice case - with a couple drawbacks.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393804800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

Currently upgrading SSD to a 480GB model (which for the price, this one should have been that large).  i5 keeps things speedyNOTE: If you go to upgrade this model&#39;s SSD, make sure you do so with an mSATA hard drive (looks like a circuit board).  I will tell you that they say there are two hard drives setup in RAID 0 but that is absolutely not the case (at least for mine).  I had a single 120GB drive inside.  I&#39;m glad I looked before buying two drives...Battery life: ~1-3 hrs depending on load.  Extended battery adds about 2-4 hrs.  Basically is just goes into the same jack as the power cable and then you rotate it to snap onto the back.  Two little screws tighten into the bottom and it&#39;s secured.  Just be careful as it&#39;s easy to torque the battery and damage the power jack.  I would recommend not connecting it unless absolutely necessary.Peripherals:  Only 2 usb 3.0 ports but thanks to a bluetooth mouse, this isn&#39;t likely a problem.  Still, would have to rely on buying a 4 port hub to allow for additional devices.  Keyboard buttons seem fine, I like the chiclet style and it&#39;s backlit well.  The display adapter is a micro HDMI.  They were smart to include an adapter dongle that plugs into this, but only for VGA.  I don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t include a micro-&amp;#62;HDMI, considering that&#39;s what most monitors use anymore.  You&#39;ll likely need to spend another $10 to get this adapter.  There&#39;s also a USB adapter for a CAT5 ethernet cable in case you only have access to a hardline for internet.  Useful in niche situations I suppose.Screen: Clear and bright, about what you&#39;d expect.  Also it&#39;s touch.  If you&#39;re not used to it, it takes a little practice, but definitely makes sense with Windows 8.  Obviously not very large.Sound:  OK, considering speaker size.  Loud enough for most situations.  Use headphones if it&#39;s too loud elsewhere.Finish:  Feels solid yet very light and compact.  Nice brushed metal finish.  Product is misrepresented.  Will NOT open to 178 degrees unless you break it.  135-140 TOPS.  Probably not a huge issue for some, but not what is advertised.  Fan noise is very low until it kicks up the processor.  Even then, it&#39;s not a big deal and usually goes off in about 5 minutes.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Good performance for a price&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404086400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

Tuggle&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;I read and watched everything I could find for weeks before purchasing this on Amazon. I needed something strong for use a few times each week in local travel and it came down to this Davis and Sanford model vs. its closest competitors (Fancier Studio 270a and Ravelli AVTP).  I chose this one because I needed more height than the other two offer (note they all have the bowl mount - not the crank up center piece - very important for quick leveling). I&#39;m 6&#39;4\&quot; and am very comfortable viewing through the camera even with the legs spread out all the way --- lens height maybe 5&#39;10\&quot; or more (guessing). It also seemed to be more beefy where the leg extentions are concerned.  I assume all the heads are good, but can say this FM18 head is a dream to use. It is extraordinarilly smooth and can be locked securely if needed.I do not have the other tripods to compare, but can say without reservation that this was a very, very good choice and incredible value.  By the way, there has been some confusion about what the \&quot;XB\&quot; in the model means...I have no idea. The leg decal just has branding and says \&quot;7518B.\&quot; This model came with the nice carrying bag, two plates, both 3/8 and 1/4 interchangeable mounting screws etc; it is 100% complete. Maybe the \&quot;X\&quot; part means it does not have the dolly. Beats me. Doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m super happy with this thing in every way.*** UPDATE - March 4, 2014 ***BUY IT! This has been used almost daily in some rough environments with great results (not good - GREAT!) and I must say, if you also need this as a foundation for a 4- to 8-foot jib crane or a slider, proceed with 100% confidence. Steady as a rock, extremely smooth pan and tilt, and very durable. One of the best buys I have ever made. Period. I honestly can&#39;t imagine why anyone would spend $$hundreds more for the identical super performance. This is an amazing value.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Buy with confidence - AWESOME VALUE!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389052800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

You have to take the time to scan and set the stations which is pretty tedious and time consuming.

My P25 system came in on my home transmitter site for about 50 miles.  It picked up at least two or more sites for the entire trip.Surprisingly, the reception on VHF and UHF bands was also excellent.  I picked up a fire dispatch call from home when I was over 60 miles away on VHF.Anyone considering this antenna for a low profile scanner antenna will be pleased.  If your scanner has a BNC antenna connector, you will need an adapter.

RuggedDefinitely rugged. The case cover everything from the display and all the ports.2. ButtonsThe buttons to press the power, volume are surprisingly good and feels like a real button. If you try other cases, you will know once you put the case, the button can be hard to press. This is not true with this case.3. Good viewing angle for both horizontal and vertical.4.

You can remove the keyboard and just use the ipad.Sometimes, I just remove it to use it on the bed. The kickstand works well too.7.

It has a magnetic latch in addition to the fold-over sort of strap that you often see on Ipad cases. Memory card slots are nice and snug, though it&#39;s hard to say how they would hold up to repeated use. It can also be used as a stand if you&#39;re just using it for the tablet, though it only provides a single angle.The holes seem to line up with all the inputs and speakers decently.The bad:It&#39;s not the easiest thing to get bound onto the T100, and so when you do, you might be reluctant to remove it again. Considering that it&#39;s a detachable machine, that could wind up being a problem for some people. Another problem is that attaching or detaching the screen while it stays in the binding is difficult, and can force some awkward positions that may lead to sloppy/incomplete connections (in an attachment scenario). This was a serious disappointment for me, as I had hoped that I might be able to detach it within the case and flip it over to use as a tablet.Another problem is that the straps that hold the screen in place can get in the way of your swipes for the charms bar or app screen if you&#39;re holding it in landscape. It&#39;s not impossible, but it&#39;s annoying.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;T100 version review&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1388534400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

Installation was a bit tricky though. The connector was so stiff it pulled the riser right off of my ASUS motherboard when I attempted to reseat/adjust things. Thankfully, I was able to put the riser back on the board without damage.Additionally, there was an alignment issue with the actual internal reader slot and chassis/bezel. Placing the first MicroSD card was a bit difficult as it was way too tight and felt like something was going to break. I gently rocked the card to the left and right and that aligned the slot behind the bezel with the bezel perfectly. It would have been nice to not have these issues out of the box, but I was able to make it work without modification. 4 stars for now.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;overall&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">4.0</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;summary&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Good Reader/Write - Installation Gotchas!<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;unixReviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">1397520000</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;reviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>04 15, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

I was close to giving them a 3 star rating, but the rating system says &amp;#34;I dont like it&amp;#34; is two stars so that is what they get.  If they were $20 bucks or less I would have gone three stars, but not at this price.  The sound quality is not good at all.  Also the earbuds are so huge that I can not figure out how about half of the population can even wear them.  I am a larger person than normal, 6 ft with a large head and they are even bigger than I can comfortably wear.  That said, I do agree that these wont fall out easily, which to me appears to be their only redeeming quality.  I will use them as I do all of my earbuds.  I have about 7 pairs and just grab whatever is nearby for my phone, laptop, nook, and 3 or 4 mp3 players I have.  I just wont be using these as much as the rest.Back to my $10 dollar Sony styles for my future purchases.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I would spend money elsewhere&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395619200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 24, 2014&quot;}</td>

I liked it from the beginning, but held off reviewing it because of some reviewers comments that it did not hold up under use. This has not been my experience. I looks as good and functions as well today as it did the first day I got it.The best thing about this case is how well it works as a stand for watching video. I think it works better than any other case I have used that features the same &amp;#34;cover folded into a triangle&amp;#34; stand mode. There is a magnet in the lip of the foldable cover, that besides being used to wake and sleep the tablet, helps secure the cover when folded into stand mode.For me, the second best thing is how easy it is to remove the tablet from the case. When I am using the tablet at home for reading, I prefer going caseless, and this case makes it very easy to do that. It is also very easy to replace the tablet in the case when I am done. I also haven&#39;t noticed that repeated removal and replacement of the case has caused the case to fit the tablet less well.My only complaint about the case is that both the power button and the volume rocker are a little harder to use when the case is on. To be fair to the case manufacturer, I should add that the difficulty of using these controls is my main criticism of the Nexus 7 with or without a case.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Very Nice Case, Good Value&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395705600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 25, 2014&quot;}</td>

Using a manual setting to take advantage of the f/2.8 aperture proved to me that this lens is, without a doubt, worth the investment!  I was considering the same lens with the IS, but at $1,000 more, it was out of reach financially speaking.  On a side note, even though the description is not clear, this lens does come with the tripod mounting ring, which I recommend using with a monopod or tripod.  The picture doesn&#39;t clearly show it, but it is there.  I also highly recommend getting a UV filter (77mm) to help protect the front glass.  In regards to image quality, I am very happy with how my night softball game pictures came out.  I need to use it more during to day to provide accurate feedback.  Overall, if you are thinking about getting this lens, I think you should change that thinking to action.  I do not think you&#39;ll be disappointed.*While photographing the game, I used a monopod to help keep the images clear because this lens, or as I should say, this piece of glass, is heavy!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Worth the investment!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394928000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

Having them put reimbursements/refunds on an Amazon gift card even added 3% more!  All I can say is that the folks there are great to deal with.  We have made a claim where we had to call it in because we submitted the wrong receipt and the service rep had me email the receipt right then and she attached it for me.  She also went through every other active warranty and made sure the receipts were there and verified them with me.  We&#39;ve also made a claim online, never spoke to anyone and had the claim resolved and reimbursed in less than a week - even having to return an item to them!  That is service above and beyond.  Square Trade absolutely is the best warranty.  Combined with Amazon, you&#39;ve got a combination that cannot be beat!

If you are not old enough to remember those, they looked likeQty 200 New 5 1/4 Inch 1.2 MB Floppy Disks Diskettes Redexcept generally in black, and they are now called Legacy floppy disks.  I still have work saved on those things.  Scary, huh?  The computer started with a C Prompt and when you loaded in the program and the things you needed, then you had to switch out discs as you worked.  I had a second drive to save work on so at least I was saved that indignity.  Word Perfect was a language all its own.  The shortcut keys and the F keys were a beautiful thing: a language.  Once you learned it, it was always there somewhere.Anyway, WordPerfect was First Class all the way.It may still be, but I have no way of knowing that.WordPerfect Office x7 should have been very easy to set it up.  The DVD comes in the box, which was a novelty, not the box, but the DVD.  But my computer said it was blank.  The directions sent me to a website that no longer exists.1. Blank disc;2. sent me to a web address that does not exist;3. Contacted support by chat &amp; was told to download it from the disk OR to copy it to a USB and download it;4. Repeated the explanation for the problem and was told to contact technical support;5. Finally found a webpage, selected support and was given a list of options to watch videos or open prewritten sections to give me help OR to give me help IF I had a warranty support code.  ALL for Word Perfect Office X6.  (This is not.);6. When clicking on the option How to install from the disc/Bad disc, it suggests:a. To use a different discb. Wipe the disc with a soft clothc. Check to see if I have a dual layered DVD drive to install CorelDRAW;7. Going back to the beginning to get support for a product,  WordPerfect Office is not listed as a choice.Considering that I, as the user, was not to blame for the bad disk, the website gave me a lot of runaround.  Instead I was delivered into the many circles of hell.This review was written with Word.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;This review was written with Word.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404086400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

The kids were so excited about how it worked, they didn&#39;t want to plug into the wall anymore. So I had to stop that habit.It&#39;s simple to operate. Hold down the power button for a few seconds to turn it on or turn it off. And you can get a couple extra USB cables to charge your devices and wrap them around the iCarrier.It should have 500 charge cycles, so for me that should last several years. And I shouldn&#39;t have to hear the panic of &amp;#34;Daddy, I&#39;m at 2%!!!&amp;#34;<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;overall&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">5.0</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;summary&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>So far so good<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;unixReviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">1398902400</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;reviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>05 1, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

The mouse was also flatter than most that I was used to, but I think I would have gotten used to it.

It was becoming increasingly unhandy and annoying to get down on the floor in a dark space whenever I needed to insert a USB memory stick or plug in one of the many devices that charge and/or sync via USB.  I had also run out of USB ports on my computer, thus I was always having to unplug something to plug something else in.So I got one of these, plugged it in to just 1 of the USB ports on my computer, and put this device itself in the pull-out keyboard tray under my desk.  Now when I need to plug in a USB memory stick, I can do so into a USB port that is right at my fingertips.  And I now have enough USB ports so I can leave the cords for 2 of my phones/devices permanently attached to ports on this device, which is also very handy.The low profile of this device made it perfect for keeping in my pull-out keyboard tray.My only complaint, albeit a tiny one, is that this device is so small and light that it slides around and won&#39;t stay put.

I thought it would do what I needed but I was wrong. After finishing the assembly and getting on my roof and mounting it to the existing antenna pole with my older boom type antenna......it did absolutely NOTHING. I looked more and found this antenna. Although it only had a handful of reviews they were mostly 5 star with one being a 4 star. So I took the gamble and bought this  I am glad I did. This is a very nice antenna. It is nice looking, well constructed and seems to be made of good material. I finished the assembly required, mounted it on the side of my antenna pole and instantly picked up two channels that were fringe channels with my older boom type antenna and also picked up 3 more channels that were not received at all with the boom antenna. I am very pleased with this antenna and have no doubt that it would have picked up the ones I am already getting with my boom antenna as well. But I bought this to augment my boom antenna, not replace it. I thought if I got a couple of smaller antennas and pointed them slightly different than the boom, I might get better coverage. I would highly recommend this antenna. It has done a good job for me and I think it will for you as well.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Very nice antenna and works well.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398384000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 25, 2014&quot;}</td>

The original shipment arrived more than a month from the date it was shipped (NOT the fault of Proporta, mind you--Customs?

In fact, I own two cases for each Kindle Fire HDX. Still, I was willing to try out another case, especially when it retails for half the price of the Origami.Two things jumped out for me when I first saw theTek-nical Case by Incipio: there&#39;s an elastic band to hold the Kindle Fire HDX in place and there are no magnets, which on the Origami allows me to automatically turn off my Kindle Fire HDX when I close it.It isn&#39;t realistic to expect either the Tek-nical Case or the Origami Case to save the Kindle Fire HDX from a 10-foot drop onto concrete. In our household, the cases are used to protect the screen from spills and scratches. So, the Tek-nical Case lack of functions really puts it behind the Origami Case.CONS:* The Tek-nical Case is only stable for landscape hands-free viewing. In portrait mode, the case slides and wobbles.* There are no magnets, so the Kindle Fire HDX won&#39;t automatically turn off when the case is closed.* The elastic band has a cheap feel and doesn&#39;t inspire confidence.You get what you pay for. If price is your first consideration, the Tek-nical Case will probably fit your needs. If functionality is more important to you, I recommend theAmazon Kindle Fire HDX Standing Polyurethane Origami Case.Rating: Three stars&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Magnets are better than elastic bands&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400112000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

Remote controls and local iPod/iPhone/iPad volume control capabilities. Plug and Play, works and fits very well with latest iPod 6th generation tiny Nano, iPod Touch 4th generation, iPhone 4 and iPad. Bluetooth iPod Adapter. (Electronics)I&#39;ve wished for many years that iPod was Bluetooth. So imagine my happiness to find this little Kokkia BT dongle!! Yes, happy.I just purchased this lovely Kokkia i10s Tiny Bluetooth iPod Transmitter, and have the awesome LG HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset. I have a iPod Classic 160 GB. I had a little trouble pairing it on my own, so I went to www dot Kokkio dot com/faq/i10spairingconnecting dot html to help me pair it and I paired it instantly following the easy directions.ORHERE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PAIRING EITHER ANY BLUETOOTH \&quot;iDEVICE\&quot; to any BT compatible; RECEIVER, CAR RADIO, SPEAKER OR HEADSET:Please refer to below steps (in the steps an iDevice = iPod or iPhone or iPad or iPod Touch):1) First make sure your iDevice battery, and your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker battery are charged.2) a) Power OFF your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker.2) b) Turn OFF the Bluetooth of any other Bluetooth devices (including the native Bluetooth of any iPhone or iPad or iPod Touch, etc).This step is very important, as other Bluetooth devices will connect to any previously paired/connected device if they are not disabled, causing the i10s not to be able to pair/connect to your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker.3) Power ON the iDevice (make sure the iDevice LCD screen is lighted up at this step), the i10s is NOT plugged into iDevice at this step.4) Put your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker into pairing mode (check your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker user guide for how to put your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker in pairing mode).5) Insert the i10s into iDevice. After several seconds, the blue led on i10s will start to quick flash.6) When the i10s and your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver are paired and connected the i10s blue LED will slow flash once in every ~5 secs7) If you don&#39;t hear any music on Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker, check to make surea. iDevice is not in pause mode. If in pause mode, change to play modeb. iDevice volume is not at minimum - move the volume control on iDevice to make sure volume changes and not at minimum.c. Your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker volume is not at minimum, if at minimum - increase your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker volume.8) If unsuccessful, remove i10s from iDevice. Power off your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker. Repeat steps 1 to step 7 again. If fail 3 times, steps 1-7, let us know.The LG headset controls my iPod Classic very well. I believe to choose another album to play on iPod, you would have to do that on the iPod itself. However, with my headset I can control volume, FF to next song or Reverse to last song or go back to beginning of album by several presses of the Back Reverse button on my headset. Now I am motivated to plan out more LONG playlists on my iPod. Yeah!!Other reviewers have said to put iPod volume at maximum, this was too loud for me on my LG headset&#39;s lowest setting, SO I put the iPod volume at just a bit above 1/2 level, and now volume control on headset goes from a nice low but well heard volume to just 5 or 6 clicks of headphone up volume button takes me right into the WAY TOO LOUD level.ALSO, I do know that volume setting when higher does deplete the iPod battery life quite a bit faster. So, half way for me works nicely. So if this helps save battery power and iPod battery lasts longer, YAY!UPDATE ON MY EXPERIMENT: My iPod BATTERY LIFE EXPERIMENT WITH KOKKIO BT DONGLE: I started playing my iPod Classic 160GB On Friday 2/7/14 at 5:18 pm. Stopped play at 10:03pm = 4.75 hoursSaturday: started at 11:00am, stopped at 5:42 pm. = 6 hr 42 min.TOTAL = 11 hr 16 minHOWEVER, I did leave the Kokkio dongle plugged into iPod on Friday evening, iPod battery level was about 70%, BUT when I restarted iPod Saturday at 11am, battery level was at about 40% on my iPod.Conclusion, possibly the Kokkia Dongle draws power from iPod battery if left plugged in even though it&#39;s not BT connected to anything.I will redo my experiment again on full batteries, early in the day so I don&#39;t have to interrupt it for sleep.Then another day I will leave Kokkia Dongle plugged into iPod when it&#39;s fully charged to see if there is battery drainage by the end of the day.EXPECT AN UPDATE.I placed my iPod with the Kokkia BT dongle inserted, and placed it on the kitchen breakfast bar which is central in my home 1980sq.ft. and I&#39;m able to walk throughout my home without any cutting out. So range for me is good.Battery info, just a FYI re my experiences. As an ex Electronic Test technician, I tend to discharge ALL batteries that are rechargeable totally and completely, then give the item-battery a full charge without interruption. (I have one of the first hard drive mp3 players, Rio Riot, that is 13 years old, that still carries a charge for about 14 hours. I still have it and it works.) RC car enthusiasts use a lightbulb to drain their batteries before recharging them for this very same reason. I do NOT believe there is NO battery memory problems with NiMH batteries like what was known on NiCad rechargeables back many years ago.iPod CASE and this Kokkio: I had researched iPod cases, as most of my clothing does not have pockets available, so I need a belt clip case. I did find a nice protective case that I might want that does hook to your waistband or belt. This is the case: http://www.amazon.com/CrazyOnDigital-Premium-Leather-Classic-Package-Black/dp/B002AF5184/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_topHowever, my issue/questions was whether the Kokkio BT dongle would fit into the case fully. Now that I have the Kokkia dongle in my iPod, see that the Kokkia BT dongle is actually a little bit smaller and has very smooth rounded edges compared to the charging plug/cord USB for iPod, and there is a cutout in the case to fit the charge plug. SO, I feel that this Kokkia BT dongle will fit fine with this or any other iPod case you might want to purchase because all of them have the cutout for the charging cord. .I DO UPDATE ALL my reviews as needed on ALL electronics goodies, also after 6 months and then again about a year after purchase and use, so if a few years goes by without an update, it&#39;s still working fine. LOL, or I died. But I do have many years left if life goes to plan.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Pairing Instructions in my Review. So Far, So Good! Kokkia! Good job!,&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391817600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

It then it sat in the snow for about an hour before I started rolling it home.When I got home I wanted to check and see if the case really held up as advertised. Because of the temperature difference, I decided to leave it alone overnight before opening it. Needless to say the case worked beautifully! The camera, lenses, and countless other electronics were all in tact! I&#39;m sure theSilica Gel packI used was also a factor in this.I am very impressed with this case. I&#39;ve stood on it to get higher shots, dragged it up and down stairs, and generally handle it in a carefree manner (It IS fairly heavy). It hasn&#39;t broken yet and it&#39;ll surely hold up for years to come. I will definitely be purchasing another for my audio gear, which, unfortunately, is still stranded in a plastic bin inside my car...&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Already Paid for Itself&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392249600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 13, 2014&quot;}</td>

She constantly had issues with choppy phone calls, and we were able to narrow the problem to packet loss caused by the Edimax bridge. We connected her VoIP box through her laptop instead and it works fine. She still uses the Edimax bridge for internet access on her machine, but it is slow and unreliable.In short, if you&#39;re thinking of using this for VoIP or gaming, which are both severely affected by packet loss, forget about it.

That means if you have a large USB drive or accessory, they could block the adjacent ports (could be another USB or something else, like an HDMI port).These fit perfectly into a USB slot and don&#39;t extend out any further.Great product and feel much sturdier than plastic &amp;#34;freebies&amp;#34; that I get from trade shows.I&#39;m using these for archiving/recovery so I don&#39;t use them often, but so far, they&#39;ve been great, seem fast, best of all, don&#39;t block adjacent ports!<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;overall&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">5.0</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;summary&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>solid, sturdy and won&#39;t block adjacent ports!<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;unixReviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">1391040000</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;reviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>01 30, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

Side by side photos on the screen look the same (d50 is 6.0 megapixel). Printed there is probably a difference. However, this camera is much faster in burst mode and also shoots video, which is why I got it. What I miss is the internal motor for AF on older lenses, but I can handle focusing manually. Non AF-S lenses are (mostly) still compatible, which is why I like Nikon. I don&#39;t have any complaints, it just wasn&#39;t the step up from the D50 that I had imagined. Video quality is OK, I wish I could get 60 FPS on the highest resolution. I&#39;ve had it for nearly two years and it still functions perfectly and I have even dropped it once (the lens also still functions perfectly but the plastic casing didn&#39;t survive.) Recommended if you want a good camera that gives you a great auto mode and also full manual controls, but to be honest, the smaller camera systems are starting to go down in price and the size of those is very attractive, and the sensor is the same size, such as the samsung nx300. If I was buying today, I&#39;d go that route.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great camera, easy to use, but I miss the internal motor&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389571200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 13, 2014&quot;}</td>

First the installation of the iPad into the case is very simple, just line it up with the correct orientation and just push it in place until the sides click into position. Once the iPad is installed it can then rotate 360 degrees to view in landscape or portrait view.  The side of the case that sits up against the screen has a soft, felt-like material so as to be very good at not scratching your screen.  Some of the material (be it vinyl or leather-like) on the blue and white part has some wrinkles around the corner of the case, however this is not a deal breaker as it&#39;s not peeling or coming off in any way it just shows that it&#39;s not something that is of perfect quality.  AS for the closing of the case, I have not experienced any of the indicated problems that others may have had with the magnets not shutting the screen off.  I have tested it and it takes about a quarter to half and inch of separation before the screen will come back on.  One thing I have noticed, if you set your iPad down and don&#39;t use the elastic band, just make sure you set it down with the large red part on the bottom and the iPad screen facing downward, that way the weight of the iPad will force itself as close to the red part of the case with the magnet in it.  With the elastic band securing the iPad to the red portion, We have had no problems setting it down in any orientation.  Overall a great case for the price and my wife and I are very happy with the case and it&#39;s performance.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great case!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390694400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

Can&#39;t believe how beautiful the hd display is,  One thing I am upset about is the fact that for some reason there were already some books listed in my kindle that I definitely do not want.  I can only delete what I download apparently, so there is no way to get rid of these unwanted books.  Did not cost me anything, but I still have to see them in my list.  It has taken me a while to get used to how things work with out instructions.  Also there doesn&#39;t seem to be any way to stop listening to music that was transferred from my computer. Go back to home but it keeps on playing.  I have to shut the kindle off entirely to get it to stop.  So I won&#39;t be bothering to get any more music from Amazon unless I can figure this out.  I guess these are small agravations, but I should not have to put up with them.  Not really much in the  kindle free time for preschoolers unless I subscribe.  Didn&#39;t really buy it for grandkids anyway, but checked it out.  All in all I guess I did get a good deal as it was marked down by $80.  I have also noticed that a lot of the free books are the 1st one of a series.  That way they hope you will get interested enough to buy the next books.

My goal was to put an antenna in my attic safe from the Florida weather and racoons.  Yes, I had a raccoon climbing my antenna pole and getting into my attic from the roof(ugh!).  I am pretty far from tv stations so I ended up sending this antenna back and getting a channel master 4228 antenna with a cm7777 booster.  The latter proved much more powerful and I get a ton of stations including all the main broadcasters.

They sound like they expect $50 quality from $9 gloves (S&amp;H; included!).For the price, they&#39;re pretty amazing. Decent quality, decent colors on the gloves. PLUS, you get a really nifty technology, a cord you can plug into your computer that heats up the blood flowing into your hands.I&#39;m impressed at how quickly they heat up--almost instantly. The cords have a nice &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; feature--they will disconnect if you move too far away, rather than, say, drag your computer off your desk.That said, I can&#39;t deny they make me nervous. I guess the worst that could happen is a minor shock, but still.. The problem is they get too warm and start making you sweat. Water + electricity = dangerous. Also, oddly enough, the velcro glue heats up, and it comes off pretty easily.I took the velcro off and just stick them partway in, and that seems to work better. I&#39;m actually thinking it&#39;d be better to attach them on the outside of the wrist part. Might not be great to look at, but I think it&#39;d be safer and feel better anyways.You&#39;re buying a cheap product, so don&#39;t expect the moon. :)&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;They Do The Trick&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390262400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 21, 2014&quot;}</td>

I installed it on my surface and it will never be in the way.Its very responsive, the track ball moves super easy, the scroll wheel works nice 4 top buttons are easy to press.It has a tracking speed adjustment button right on the mouse (3 -Positions)It charges with a provided usb cable and you can use it while you charge.While it didn&#39;t come with a lanyard i did attach one from a Wii remote and i like it there. its smaller than a Wii nunchuck so its handy to have it connected to your wrist.Looks nice overall.Cons:The track ball is a little small.  By small i mean it rattles around inside the mouse.  as if you shake it, you can hear the ball moving.  when in use you don&#39;t notice this but its got some wiggle room. (This is my first experience with a enclosed trackball so if this is standard disregard)No software or drivers available to change the function of the buttons.The trigger guard is too small for my fingers. (but works for my wife)The trigger button is Left click, and its loud.  Loud for a mouse.  Its more like clicking that safety seal on a Snapple its loud.The track ball speed controller button, while handy is also within the trigger, and if you have a bigger finger you can tap it with normal use quite easily.Overall:I don&#39;t love it but i had to start somewhere.  The cost seems to be worth the device.  I was expecting this device to contain a laser pointer, I was wrong this modes is not equiped with one.  At the end of the day its $25 well spent considering the other choices. My primary reason for purchase was to connect to my Surface to my TV and then use this as a remote for Hulu and such.  For this it works well.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Its what is available at the moment&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392076800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 11, 2014&quot;}</td>

I have a 39GB file that I took using a laptop. It was about an hour and a half of a speech and important to me. My laptop ran out of battery power during the compression process. The raw video was still intact, but there is no way to restart the compression process or to get at the raw video. I&#39;m screwed. I have no video and a 39GB file that cannot be turned into any kind of video. There&#39;s not even a way to strip the audio out of it.

They block out engine noise so you can hear your headset audio.  However, the sound is average for as much as they are I was expecting full sound.  It lacks the lows that I like.  It is nice how the Bose folds up into its carrying case.  I imagine the Bose will last a long time with this feature.Compared to Fata1ty Gaming HeadsetThis is a great headset the simulated surround sound from games is noticeable and it has a built in mic for chat.  Audio quality is good having good lows and good highs.  Comfort is severely lacking. Long wear hurts.The Bluedio R+ are the best.Pros:Cheaper then the Bose and sound a lot better.  They do not block as much outside noise but they make up for it with great sound.They are more comfortable than the Bose and Creative headset.They are half the price of the Bose.They are wireless!Cons:No micFlashing blue light is distracting (not sure what it even means, is the battery going dead? is it just telling me that it&#39;s connected?)Overall highly recommend!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Amazing!

So, I am to wait 10-14 days to get this Vizio possibly working? No thanks. Amazon ate this TV with special shipping both ways.It&#39;s my advice to stay away from having to use a special carrier from Amazon if you desire an item quickly.

It is manufactured as well as an iPhone, and the aluminum and glass is very sturdy and feels nice. The small plastic bits are also very solid and clearly not just cheap plastic fillers, but well thought out and meticulously placed.I would definitely say that the quality of this unit far surpasses any other GPS on the market today. If you&#39;re considering this unit or one of the cheaper Nuvi&#39;s, the upgrade to this one is worth it for several reasons:1) Capacitive glass touch screen. Priceless. Soooo much better than the resistive squishy ones.2) 3D Contoured map. Looks cool and is great for off-roading. Not a dumb flat planametric map.3) Magnetic quick-mount. If you take your sat-nav off the windshield when you park, this is priceless.4) Build quality. This is a solid machine. It feels amazing in the hand, it&#39;s more art than GPS.The voice control is especially satisfying. Address entry works every time. Searching for businesses by name is hit or miss depending on the popularity, et cetera. I use the keyword &amp;#34;nuvi go!&amp;#34; which picks up every time and impresses all of my passengers.It works better than most GPS recievers. I especially enjoy the detailed directions it gives in complicated settings, like multiple freeway interchanges, et cetera. I loaded topographic maps from gpsfiledepot.net onto this for use off-roading in my Jeep.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Never been happier with a GPS&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401321600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 29, 2014&quot;}</td>

However, just like some reviewers said, I also experienced several &amp;#34;connecting-disconnecting&amp;#34; moments. I tried to shake or change the position, but the problem persisted. I thought that it is not fully compatible with my Mac, so I plugged it to my Windows PC, but the problem persisted. Then, I thought that the cable might be broken. So, I tried another cable that I have which I know it works fine with my laptop and other device, but the same things happened. Therefore, I think that the problem might be in the port at the hard disk.I contacted Amazon customer service to ask their suggestion. I expected that I just got a defective product and I could ask for replacement, because I like this product. However, because the company doesn&#39;t offer me that option, I decided to return it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The port might be problematic&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400889600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 24, 2014&quot;}</td>

Firstly, these are the most comfortable \&quot;normal\&quot; buds I&#39;ve ever tried. When I say normal, I mean that they&#39;re not as comfortable as the Skullcandy Fix due to the unique shape of the Fix.In terms of sound, it does have great bass. In all honesty, to me they&#39;re not as powerful as others have described. But sound is a funny thing.. We all hear things a little bit differently. And due to the fairly powerful sound system I have in my car, perhaps I&#39;m a bit \&quot;spoiled\&quot;. And by that, I mean in my car I&#39;m use to literally feeling the bass, not just hearing it. That being said, it&#39;s incredible that such tiny buds can give such a bass presence.Compared to the Skullcandys, it definitely has better, deeper, more accurate bass... And while the rest of the ranges are pretty damn decent, it&#39;s not quite as refined as that of the Skullcandys.Overall I&#39;m very very pleased with these, I just wish they could provide more bass, but like I said, perhaps my expectations are too high.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great buds&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395446400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 22, 2014&quot;}</td>

After editing the acting scenes (which had 1 person with a mic), you could barely tell the difference between the 2.I did get a dead cat for it for a beach wedding I&#39;m doing in a couple of weeks. The wind gusts can get up to 10-15mph easily. So to test, I mounted the DR-05 on a tripod VERY securely, put the dead cat on, opened my sun roof and drove up to 20mph while talking. It picked up great!! Sure, I looked insane driving down the road with a fuzzy electronic box sticking out of my car, but my neighbors are used to me.I would definitely recommend it to anyone because of the clarity, ease of use and being able to use a microSD card. I had been using an Olympus 701M for voice recordings during weddings. It&#39;s much smaller, and I may use that still to mic the officiants. But I&#39;m going to make the DR-05 for anything and everything where I want to get good clear audio.

From the variety of the buds, I expected truly fantastic sound range.  It is important to get the ear buds to fit tightly to get the best sound.  When the buds are hanging around your neck, they have magnets that clasp them together so they form a loop that won&#39;t fall from your neck.The Bluetooth picked up just as fast as any Bluetooth I&#39;ve used.  The unit charged in about two hours and it also comes with a USB - Micro USB wire for charging.  But there are too many problems for a product of this price.The sound is fair at best.  The treble is good, the mid-range is adequate and the bass is about what you would get from an Apple ear bud.  I really expected more sound quality, given the size of the earpiece.  There are other Bluetooth earphones out there that sound great, like the `Brightech Active 2 Bluetooth Stereo Headset&#39; at one-fourth the price.

I just received the brown leather colored version, and am very happy with it, but first let me give the iGadgitz specs I got using my precision 0.1gram scale and digital calipers:Weight:  4.465 oz. (126.6g)w/ Kindle:  11.835 oz. (335.5g)Width:  4.85&amp;#34; (123mm)Height:  6.93&amp;#34; (176mm)Average closed thickness: 0.752&amp;#34; (19.1mm)So, it&#39;s actually about 0.9oz lighter than the Amazon case.  I haven&#39;t seen the precise dimensions of the Amazon case published any where, but I&#39;ve held one in a store and i think the Amazon one is slightly thinner, maybe 1/10th of an inch.  It feels nice, protects the screen from scratches and protects the body from moderate drops.  I tried the strap, and it makes it easy to hold but slightly awkward to turn the pages, however I found that if I rest my other hand near the device it&#39;s easy to lift a finger and turn the page (never liked reading books one-handed anyway).  But my favorite way to read is with the Kindle sitting upright on a stand, and this thing does it wonderfully.  It&#39;s easy to set up and close again, and the magnets unlock it every time.In my opinion it&#39;s twice as good as the Amazon case at less than half the price.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Here are the Exact Dimensions&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391212800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

My initial up front experience is that I am overall very satisfied with the improvements that Samsung has made! There are some areas I wish they improved, but overall for the price, this is an outstanding way to experience the Chrome OS. I&#39;ll touch on a few of my in-depth thoughts below, and I&#39;ll update this all in the future as I have more experience with the device. I&#39;m going to focus more on the hardware and less on the operating system or software, since the OS will remain fairly consistent across all Chromebook devices and plenty of information already exists about Chrome OS online:Design/Materials/Build Quality: As mentioned above, I went with the jet black version. This new Chromebook 2 features Samsungs \&quot;stitched leather\&quot; design to the outside of the top shell, similar to what you see if you have ever used their Galaxy Note 3. It stands out a lot more when you see it spread across a much larger device like this. I&#39;m going to be honest, I think some people are going to find this slightly tacky looking/feeling (especially the fake stitching around the edges), but personally I am a much bigger fan of it than I thought. For a computing device in this price range, you cannot really expect them to be able to throw on a full aluminum/metal case like you might find on a MacBook Pro or a higher end Ultrabook laptop. You&#39;re going to get something that is plastic or a more cost effective material, and honestly, I kind of like the way that this faux-leather design makes it stand out from other devices. And the overall build quality of the Chromebook 2 feels much improved over the original. It doesn&#39;t have as much \&quot;flex\&quot; to it, and even though it is still almost entirely plastic-based, it certainly feels like a step up. Also, compared to my Acer C720 side by side, the Samsung CB2 feels significantly higher in quality.Display: My Chromebook 2 is the 11.6\&quot; model. This is one of the very few areas where I am finding myself wishing that Samsung would have improved this new model, even if it came at a slight cost increase. The resolution on the 11.6\&quot; model is only 1366x768, which is the same as you&#39;ll find on pretty much every other Chromebook aside from the Pixel (which is way too expensive), and the upcoming 13\&quot; version of the Chromebook 2 (which will more to a full HD 1920 screen). I&#39;m actually OK with the resolution topping out at only 1366x768 on a screen of this size, but they are still using a TN-based panel when I think that they should have stepped it up to an IPS panel and really made it stand out. It&#39;s about on par with the screen on my Acer C720, doesn&#39;t feel like much of an improvement. I wouldn&#39;t consider myself too overly picky, but side by side with a device with an IPS panel, and the screen on the Chromebook 2 just looks kind of dull and washed out in comparison. According to the specs I&#39;ve seen, even the 13\&quot; version of the Chromebook 2 is going to have a TN panel (just in higher resolution), so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to hear more people complaining about this aspect.Processor/RAM: The Chromebook 2 utilizes one of Samsung&#39;s own ARM-based chips, called the \&quot;Exynos 5 Octa 5420\&quot;, which is rated at 1.9GHz. Most of the computing experiences in my life outside of smartphone use have been with either an Intel or an AMD processor; even my trusty Acer C720 Chromebook uses an Intel Celeron-based processor. I was a little hesitant to make the jump to a newer generation of Chromebook without an Intel processor since I know Acer is going to soon release a variant of the C720 with an Intel i3 chip. However, so far, I am quite impressed with how quick this Exynos 5 Octa chip has felt through normal use. I haven&#39;t run any actual benchmarking programs or applications (if someone has a suggestion, I&#39;ll be glad to try one, if they even exist for Chrome OS?), but directly comparing it side-by-side to the Acer C720 running on the 1.4GHz Celeron processor, this is no comparison. Apps load much more instantly on the new Chromebook 2, but the biggest difference can be seen when using anything that involves video. Doing a Google Hangout on my older Chromebook was always slightly laggy enough that it was moderately frustrating, especially when trying to multi-task during a hangout. That lag has seemingly disappeared with this new model, and in all honesty, I haven&#39;t found a task yet where I&#39;ve been wishing that it was faster than it is now. This may also partially be aided by the fact that the Chromebook 2 has 4gb of RAM, versus my Acer C720 which only has 2gb, and my previous experiences with the original Chromebook 1 which also only had 2gb. Either way, the improvement in speed has been fantastic and you will certainly notice it.Keyboard/Touchpad: This is one of the most important things to me on any computing device I own. Nothing is more frustrating than a keyboard with a weird design or layout that becomes a permanent hassle for the life of the device. Luckily, this might be the BEST overall feature of the Chromebook 2. Normally when I get a new device, I find myself needing a period of adjustment as I get used to the feel of a new keyboard, new keys, new layout. I found myself instantly loving the feel and use of the keyboard on the Chromebook 2. The keys feel sturdy and solid, and the spacing feels very natural between keys. The keys themselves have a very natural \&quot;curved\&quot; feel to the top of them that yields a very pleasant typing experience. Honestly the best possible comment that I think I can give an input device is that it feels so natural and correct that you immediately stop thinking about it once you start using it, and that is the case here. I didn&#39;t have many complaints about the keyboard on my Acer C720, but I can definitely say that the keyboard on this Chromebook 2 is noticeably improved and Samsung did a great job here. The touchpad itself is pleasantly wide (wider than the spacebar!) and feels accurate and smooth. Overall I can say without a doubt that this is the best keyboard and touchpad I&#39;ve used on any Chromebook device to date outside of the Pixel.Hard Drive/Storage: My 11.6\&quot; Chromebook 2 came with a 16gb solid-state hard drive, only a little over half of which is actually accessible by the user to use as storage. Everyone has different needs so opinions will vary on this, but one of the main draws of Google OS and the Chromebooks are how well they function as cloud devices. Other than space used to install apps, which for the most part are very small (20mb or less in size), almost everything else I use my Chromebooks for can be performed from the cloud or require very little onboard storage. There are many options available to store files, pictures, data on the cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc), so I honestly don&#39;t think the storage space is going to be much of an issue for most people. Plus, being that it is a solid-state drive, it is VERY fast compared to traditional hard drives in terms of accessing files and data; also, since solid state drives have no moving parts inside, a lot more stable and damage proof for lugging it around on-the-go. Unless you are going to be installing literally hundreds of apps (most people probably only regularly use two dozen or less), or unless you regularly need to work where you have no internet access at all for extended periods of time, I  think the size of the drive will suffice.Battery: This is a section I will need to update further in the future. Samsung is claiming 8 hours of battery life on a full charge. I haven&#39;t noticed anything yet that would lead me to believe this claim is false, but I also haven&#39;t owned it long enough to go through a full charge from start to finish. I&#39;ll update my thoughts on this after I have run a few full cycles through the battery.Speakers: I&#39;ll be honest, I don&#39;t personally use the built-in speakers a ton on any laptop or device I&#39;ve owned. I&#39;m typically either just using this for web browsing or productivity, but when I do listen to music with it, I&#39;ve found myself using Bluetooth to connect to external Bluetooth speakers in the past (namely my Logitech Boombox or my Jawbone Jambox if I am on the go). I did test the speakers out for a while though on my Chromebook 2, and I have to say I am fairly impressed. Considering that the speakers are located on the bottom of the device, I was surprised at how well they projected sound. And considering their tiny size, they were able to get louder than I expected while remaining fairly clear. I wouldn&#39;t expect booming base from these, but they don&#39;t sound \&quot;tinny\&quot; either and have a decent balance to them. I&#39;ll still probably stick to using my Bluetooth speakers when I want to blast music around my house or when working outdoors, but I can&#39;t see the built-in speakers disappointing anyone who came in with reasonable expectations.Other features: I&#39;ll come back to this and add to my review once I have had more time with the unit. Webcam, software, pictures, any other likes or dislikes that I find as I continue to use it further beyond the first few days.Overall, this is a great product, especially when you factor in the value that you get for the money. If I could give it partial stars, I&#39;d give it about a 4.6/5 (and the only deduction would really be because I wish they had upgraded the screen further). It&#39;s very very quick in everyday use; boots up almost instantly from sleep (or about 10 total seconds if you shut it off completely), gets very solid battery life, and ChromeOS allows you to easily do almost any normal computing task that you would normally do with Apple OS or Windows. It&#39;s very lightweight and portable, and the build quality is solid. If you come in expecting this to perform like a $1000+ i7 Ultrabook or a MacBook Pro, you might leave disappointed. But other than that, especially at a price point of just over $300 at launch, I feel like the Chromebook 2 is not only going to sell a lot of new customers on the Chrome OS, but offer a very noticeable speed and function upgrade to people who are using previous generation Chromebook models. If you have only used traditional laptops your whole life and this is your first experience into Chrome OS, your mind is going to be blown when you first realize that you are INSTANTLY at the desktop and ready to go when you open the laptop up from sleep mode. I will revisit my review and update it further as time passes and I notice new things to comment on. Anything you want me to review that I missed, let me know in the comments and I&#39;ll come back and add my thoughts.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A solid upgrade from the last generation of Chromebook models&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400112000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

But I am disappointed with this item and looking straight into replacing it after just 2 months of use.I was using Windows notebooks for most of my computing life till 2 years back when I need a light weight notebook of 2.5 Kg or below, minimum of 16GB and a Quad-core i7 notebook (I do development works and my works are mostly out of country). I ended up with Macbook pro (retina) and that is the only machine at that time that met this requirement (shame on Wintel). Fast forward now and I am looking for a same high computing power, touch screen, lighter notebook cum tablet running Win8.1. I ended up with this item after all the great reviews here and elsewhere.At the point of purchase, I accepted the following facts:1. It is only be 8GB,2. It has the yellow display problem,but:1. It is light weight2. It is flexible and able to twist into a tablet3. It is touch screen4. Reasonably price (ps. not low price)However, after just two months of usage. I reverted back to Macbook Pro for most of my usage because this item has too many design faults because Lenovo is using mostly low quality components beyond the aspect of looks.Let me highlight bellow and I these are unlikely to be a one-off problem that you might think.1. Distorted yellow colour display problem remain unresolved with the latest BIOS upgrade - Yes, despite claims from some websites, the problem is here. See it for yourself, just run MS Paint program and look at the yellow in the colour menu and compare it with the next unit in the showroom and you will know what I meant. Gee.. why give you a 3200 x 1800 ultra high resolution when you cannot even display basic colour correctly?2. Only 1 mini-HDMI (faulty) display - my job required frequent presentation. The mini-HDMI port design so poorly that most mini-HDMI cables cannot have a good contact to receive signal. 90% of the time, you are unable to display unless you make some cuttings to the cable and risk damaging them and still not working, I brought 3 cables and followed the instructions most other owners suggested and managed to get one cable to work. And this is after I stacked some objects below the connecting part to cause the connector to tilt upward (It is too complex to explain here without a diagram here but you can surely do a search on the Internet, especially the Lenovo owner forum,  to understand what I mean)3. To mitigate the above, I thought of a &amp;#8220;wise&amp;#8221; idea to overcome this shortcoming - Invest in a wireless display (Widi) since this unit supposed to support Widi. Widi allow you to connect to a projector remotely via a USB port and that perhaps can solve my problem.  I bought a Netgear PTV3000 Wireless Display Adapter. This adapter works with every of my WIDI compatible devices except Yoga 2 pro. Once again, after searching in the forum, I realise this is a design issue4. Wifi - After wasted many days of testing, I realised that this unit cannot run the dual-band WIFI 802.11n network. it will only accept the 2.4GHz band but not the faster 5GHz band and this was again confirmed by many other owners. Goodness me, when the new Macbook Air release much earlier, it uses the latest 802.11ac and my 4 years old ASUS notebook support dual-band without any problem. Beside this, moving further away from the router, my 1.5 years-old Samsung S4 connected on the same 2.4G wifi router running about 3 times faster that this notebook; I was speechless.So, my experience with this unit has been that the more you use it, the more problems you will uncover, and probably to the extent that you will end up putting it a side as a white-elephant or for my case, using it to play some youtube videos which can be done using my home TV set too.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Please do more research before you purchase&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398902400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

Chambers&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [2, 2], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;To my ears, the audio quality of the Brainwavz M5 earphones was outstanding, with some of the better bass sounds that I&#39;ve heard from a pair of earphones. The earphones fit comfortably and were effective in keeping out all but the loudest ambient noise. The ear tips that came on the set were comfortable for my ears, but there were six other sets of varying sizes and firmness, so virtually any user should be able to find a good fit. Hard-wired earphones like these don&#39;t give the freedom of movement that Bluetooth earphones have, but the tradeoff is that there&#39;s no internal battery to keep charged, and you don&#39;t have to worry about drop-outs when you&#39;re moving around.I used the M5 earphones with a playlist of songs that gave them a good workout. I first used a couple of utility MP3s (Channel Balance Test and Stepped Stereo Pan Test) to check the stereo channel balance and stereo separation, and the earphones passed with flying colors. I don&#39;t claim to be an expert audiophile, but to my ear, the sound was at least as good as any earphones that I&#39;ve used, including Bluetooth earphones.I&#39;m also impressed with the accessories that came with the earphones. The six sets of different earbuds (plus the set that&#39;s on the earphones) are a very nice touch, plus a clip for hooking the audio cable to your shirt. The hard case that&#39;s included is great for carrying everything in a very small package.In my opinion, if you&#39;re looking for a set of quality earphones, the Brainwavz M5 Earphones are definitely worth considering.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Outstanding audio from a comfortable set of wired earphones&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394064000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

For $200 I didn&#39;t expect an audiophile type headphone but when the sound exceeds your expectations that deserves an extra star.  The bass really booms.  The highs and mids are above average but don&#39;t expect Audio Technica or whatever audiophiles use.  I guess these would be compared to Beats Solos HDs but these SOL&#39;s got my vote.  And the number one factor would be durablity.But if your looking for a good durable pair of cans that you can commute on the train with (I live in NY) and not worry about snapping the headband or being rough with them this is your pair.  Whenever I wear my Beats or V-Moda&#39;s I feel like everyone is staring at them.  But these are more under the radar but with almost the same sound quality.  I like them because they are simple in design.The headband and earcups seem to be very tight (seal) on my head right now but I am hoping there is a breaking in period.  Don&#39;t get me wrong they are very comfortable but just a little tight that&#39;s all.Also I am not sure if the volume buttons are supposed to work with music but when I use my iPhone I can only use the pause button.  The volume buttons don&#39;t work.  Also the control talk sits kind of low on the wire.  If you wear a jacket or something you won&#39;t be able to reach it if you have it zipped up.They use a smaller jack then the standard 3.5 to plug into the speakers so you can&#39;t use any universal cords with these and you have to plug in both sides.

I did not use a GPS until this month. I got lost a LOT. When I started my new delivery job, it became crystal clear to me I needed a GPS or else I would soon become unemployed. A friend loaned me the Garmin 1300 nuvi, and that was okay, but I wasn&#39;t really fond of typing in addresses, because that is very tedious when one is under time pressure to get somewhere.I sprang for the extra features in this model, namely voice recognition. Let me say that voice recognition is GREAT. Yes, it is worth the extra money, and you know what, to be honest, I&#39;d pay $250 extra for it, if I had to. I don&#39;t feel like parking the car and typing on a crap touchscreen keyboard. To hell with that.The voice recognition software works like a charm, although I do have a pretty clear voice. If you have an accent or lisp, then you might want to factor that into your calculations, although maybe not. The unit does allow you to program your own, customized commands, so it can adapt to anybody&#39;s voice, as long as you&#39;re patient enough to program it once.One tip--once you enter an address and it finds it, you have to say &amp;#34;Navigate!&amp;#34; for it to start feeding you the directions. It&#39;s not automatic.Using my computer, I updated the software and the maps online using Garmin Express without any difficulty. I do wish Garmin Express worked on Linux, but I don&#39;t think it does. Unfortunately a lot of manufacturers have not gotten the memo about Linux. They are from the 1990s and still think Windows is all anyone uses. Luckily I had a Windows 7 computer lying around collecting dust somewhere, so I propped it up beside my Xubuntu machines and fired it up.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Simply the Best GPS, period&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396137600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

None of them were exemplary so I decided on this one because of how cheap it was (~ $7 dollars vs. $30 or $40 for the same star rating).  It&amp;#8217;s pretty horrible.  I&amp;#8217;m usually able to get ABC and FOX and often KCAL or channel 9 in LA and some other odd channels such as local channels that speak languages that I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8230;Armenian, Spanish, and Chinese.  Even the network channels require playing with the antenna often.  If someone has some ideas concerning antennas that are worthwhile please let me know.  This isn&amp;#8217;t one of them.  The 1950&amp;#8217;s live on.  The worst thing is trying to watch a program and having the signal go in and out which happens often with this antenna.  Another horrible issue is Amazon will only send it when they&amp;#8217;re good and ready.  I ordered it with a series video that wasn&amp;#8217;t due out for about a month in order to take advantage of the $35 or over free shipping.  They waited until that video was released to send it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Cheap but frustrating&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404691200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

I have never had a laptop electronic failure while traveling.  When you consider all of the big current equipment in hotels (elevators, ice makers, mini-fridges, etc.) that switch on and off all the time, inducing current spikes each time, these little protectors begin to sound like an worthwhile precaution.  If you prefer to use a wired Ethernet connection for better security, carry an extra patch cable and run the Ethernet cables through this device, as well as the AC power line.  Sometimes spikes enter over the network line, especially during thunderstorms.  BTW, this particular model is for 3-wire (i.e., grounded) power cables, as pointed out by other reviewers.

Instead of having 100 questions asking the same things. Many by people who are just too lazy to read the description or understand a tablet or phone they spent hundreds of dollars on.IT&#39;S A LIGHTNING ADAPTER!That means it won&#39;t work with older iPads and iPhones. It works with the ones that have the little Lightning plug, not the wider 30 pin plug.I waded through all the questions claiming it mirrors anything on my iPad or iPhone screen. I wanted a solution to use with TiVo. IT DOESNT WORK WITH TIVO! You can call TiVo, who makes an excellent DVR, but has unknowledgable support people, and they will tell you to call Apple to complain, because it is their design that prevents it from working. It is not! It is TiVo&#39;s. They choose to prevent it from working for whatever reason. Copyrights. Content providers. Marketing. Whatever.There is one solution currently for TiVo owners wanting to stream recordings or live TV to remote televisions. It is Slingbox. You can connect a Slingbox to your TiVo. Stream it to an iPad or iPhone. And then with this adapter (assuming of course, your device uses a Lightning plug), play it on a larger screen. (Also assuming you have an HDMI connection on your TV, and have an HDMI cable). You also have to purchase a $15 app for your iPhone or iPad.The other way to do it, without this adapter, is to use a Roku, or other streaming video player with a Slingbox. A caveat here is it doesn&#39;t work with iPads. Only iPhones (and some other smartphones). You need the Slingbox, Roku, iPhone (which can have any style plug, as long as it uses ios 6.1 or later), the Slingplayer app. And you have video from your home TiVo to anywhere you have a decent wifi connection.Despite the TiVo failure with this adapter, I&#39;m keeping it, but for almost $50, and inability to truly mirror anything from an iPhone or iPad, it gets 3 stars.Hope this helps.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A step up, but not the ultimate solution to video mirroring.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398643200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 28, 2014&quot;}</td>

The part that covers the iPad comes in multiple layers which helps absorb the shock due to drops.  All the ports are fully enclosed with the exception of the speakers of course.  The case itself features a film for protecting the screen.  Considering the amount of protection that&#39;s offered, the added weight is just a small sacrifice.The keyboard is also great.  The keys are very responsive and I can almost type as fast as I would on my desktop keyboard.  I wish the backspace key was a little bigger.  There are many iOS shortcut keys which are actually useful.The bluetooth setup is pretty simple.  It connected on my first try.  Battery life is pretty good.

The overall shape and design never appealed to me. I transitioned from the Gamecube to the original xbox and was always a Xbox user. I tried many times to enjoy a Playstation console but could never get myself to like the dualshock controllers.In November I picked up the Xbox one and recently (May 2014) traded it in and switched to a PS4. The PS4 in my opinion is really targeted to gamers. The Xbox One is targeted to those who want an all around experience with games and entertainment. Don&#39;t get me wrong I enjoyed my Xbox One but with the direction Microsoft is going, doubting its decision, downgrading the price, I wasn&#39;t having it. Microsoft really cheated its early adopter by dropping the price due to the lack of interest of the kinect. Followed by having customers buy adapters for headsets and a charging kit.In this review I&#39;ll will be comparing both systems in a number of categories and explain their pros and cons in my preference.*Design*At launch as mentioned earlier I picked up the Xbox One. The design never really bothered me but it was a very large machine. It took a lot of space on my tv stand because of its size, the power brick and kinect. After switching to the PS4, I can&#39;t believe what a difference there was. The PS4 took 1/3 less room on my TV stand and was thinner. It had a better sleek design and a much more appealing look. Lets be honest the Xbox One looks like a bulky cable box. When it comes to looks the PS4 takes the win for that category.With the history of the red ring microsoft ensured to keep their new system cool in which they achieved greatly. But the top fan would collect dust along the grill and I would constantly try to wipe away any build up which was really annoying. I did like how the Xbox One had many USB ports where as the PS4 has 2. The PS4 design is slim and stylish. I like the lit up line going through the system. My one complaint is the design in the back. Being diagonal it was a little annoying plugging things in because of the recessed ports due to the back pointing out, if that made sense.Both systems share their combinations of matte and glossy finishes but the PS4 has the better stylish design while still providing slightly better hardware.*Controller*As I mentioned earlier the controller was a big deal to me. I always preferred the Xbox controller because of the triggers and the position of the thumb sticks. The Xbox One controllers felt a little bigger but I liked the design, it might not seem like a huge feature but the impulse triggers were really nice and loved that feature. Problem is the Xbox one controller requires an additional adapter no matter what headset you&#39;re using unless you&#39;re using the stock headset. Also instead of running through batteries, they sell a charging kit. In total that&#39;s an extra $45 + tax. That is ridiculous, microsofts vision of a motion sensor should completely stop in my opinion. They could of easily never added the kinect and used the extra $100 to include a charging kit and adapter.With the PS4 at first I was skeptical because I feared I would not like the new Dual shock 4. But after playing with it at the store I&#39;ve grown to like it a lot. I do like that they indented the thumb sticks because a big reason why I never liked the dual shock was because of the domed shape sticks. That&#39;s just my preference. Also the previous dual shock the L2 and R2 were weird to me because I prefer a trigger like button for shooters. They slightly changed the triggers on the DS4, it might not be a trigger like the xbox but it feels better in the hands. I love how the system came with a charging cable and any 3rd party headsets will work without any additions accessories! That was a big plus on Sony&#39;s part.Both controllers have their pros and cons, I still do favor the overall shape of the xbox controller but I am loving the Dual shock 4. I understand there have been complaints on the battery life on the Dual shock 4 but hopefully overtime quality control could change that. The quality and feel of the xbox one controller felt cheap, the plastic they used didn&#39;t seem up to par with the 360 controller. The PS4 controller really felt like a quality build.*User Interface*The Xbox Ones interface is pretty much a windows 8 appearance. The UI in my opinion was a huge step back because the UI was designed towards using voice command instead using the controller. I prefer using a controller to navigate. The Xbox One&#39;s UI is very slow in my opinion, its too flashy by having things pop in and out, a waste of load time, hiding things within category folders, and pushing what app was last used. I would constantly get frustrated in finding things and constantly closing applications. The 360&#39;s UI before the launch of the one was great. While microsoft are constantly updating its UI, its still not up to pair as a next gen in my opinion. Like the biggest complaint was checking storage space and battery life. Are you kidding me? Those two are almost standard in ANY DEVICE. The direction of the xbox UI was completely pulled back because they designed it with the kinect in mind.The PS4 design has a learning curve especially if you&#39;re coming from the xbox. But it is very simple and straight forward which I really liked. Essentially there are two home bars which hold specific icons. After sitting down getting used to the UI it is very responsive in my opinion. Things load quickily, I can easily find what I need whether it be settings, accounts, space, etc. I can easily see who&#39;s online unlike the xbox where I have to navigate through an annoying wall feed. The icons are small and titled where as the xbox have large boxes that take up space. Everything is right in front of you on the PS4 UI where the One has 3 sections. I just wished you could change the background or color of the PS4, unless I haven&#39;t noticed that feature. At times I find the blue a little too blended in with the white text.With the PS4 I experienced the UI at update 1.70? I believe so I can&#39;t compare the UI&#39;s from launch. Microsoft has been providing updates and announcements but its still not easily navigated on the PS4 in my opinion. The UI&#39;s for both systems will change overtime as we&#39;ve seen from the last generation. Overall they both has their issues and needed updates but the PS4 gets my vote for my preference in navigation.*Gameplay + Visual*The Xbox One has slightly weaker hardware because their company, microsoft focuses on software. Comparing the multi-platform games the PS4 has a slight edge from what I&#39;ve experienced.One of the best looking games Tomb Raider the Definitive Edition looks amazing both on the PS4 and Xbox One. But in my experience it ran smoother on the PS4. Multi-platform games will most likely run a higher setting on the PS4 because Sony is a hardware company and provided better parts into the system. The Xbox One could of been on the same level but included parts to compensate for their \&quot;all in one\&quot; media entertainment. I&#39;m not saying one overpowers the other but their is a slight difference on the multi-platform games. What makes each console shine is their exclusives.Forza 5 was beautiful, the cars looked incredibly detailed and the sound was amazing. Forza 5 shows the Xbox One can compete graphically with the PS4. Another game which showed off its hardware was Dead Rising 3 which I heavily enjoyed. The amount of polygons (character models, zombies) was amazing. I really felt surrounded with a never ending crowd of zombies. It didn&#39;t run a high frame rate because of the amount of objects that were shown on the screen at once. Its a graphic sacrifice to show that many models on one screen. I am eager to see what 343 does with Halo 5, Halo 4 really pushed the limits of the XBox 360 and that was a beautiful game.As of this review I played Infamous SS and I was in love. That game looks incredibly beautiful especially with the recently added feature of taking screen shots within the game bring it to another level. While this was the only exclusive I played on the PS4 as of right now I can say that infamous is one of the best looking games out there now (May 2014). It ran very smooth and the details within the game looked nice and crisp. I loved the detail to how the main character absorbed his powers with the neon lights. An exclusive I look forward to is another Naughty Dog produces, the first being the remastered version of the Last of Us and hopefully a new Uncharted.*Xbox Live and PS Plus*- The Xbox shines in this category because they&#39;ve been in designing hardware the longest out of the two. Plus even though Playstion owners would bash xbox users for paying for xbox live, that money (or so I hope) was used to create a better service. To make sure it was secure, better connectivity, dedicated servers and market. I still feel like $60 for a year is still of a steep price. But I recommend to those who are looking into getting Xbox Live to always wait for prices drops. You can find Xbox Live deals going for $35-$40 for a year membership. The xbox live market will always be a better market because of the paying members. But like I mentioned earlier the UI designed pulled back xbox live. Going through the market is sometimes slow and the arrangement isn&#39;t clean. Xbox Live Gold members as of now have access to demos, streaming services, and games with gold.- PSN Plus and the Playstation store is great, but they will eventually catch up to the level of xbox live due to the growing paying members of plus. The Playstation store has a little learning curve for me coming from the xbox, but it wasn&#39;t hard. If anything it was easier to find things and view the different offers in the playstation store. The price for a year is $50 but you can find deals going for $30-$40 at times. The other day during the Watch Dogs release PS store was doing a maintenance. While it was annoying especially during a peak launch of a new game, it gave me confidence that Sony is really trying to develop and improve their online service. Similar to gold, play station does offer free games to plus users.*Overall and final thoughts*Both systems have their pros and cons. Each pro and con can be different to each their own, it really is up to the user on how they are going to use the system and what they prefer. The way I see it as if you prefer the exclusives on the Xbox One, choose the Xbox One. You&#39;ll be getting a system that has their great line up of exclusives, Dead Rising 3, Halo 5, Sunset Overdrive, etc. Plus a system that really provides entertainment through media apps and if you plug in your tv. Tie that with kinect using voice command, its a nice set. But thats if you purchase the console with kinect since in June they will be releasing a Xbox One without kinect at $399. I took that drop as a slap to the face from microsoft who were early adopters, plus xbox live gold, and the additional accessories.If exclusives aren&#39;t a big deal to you and you&#39;re just an average user I would say to choose the PS4. You&#39;ll have a slightly better looking multi-platform games, plus PS4&#39;s great exclusives. You can still use the console for media such as Netflix, Amazon Instant and more.But for those who are looking for a \&quot;gaming\&quot; console, I honestly would go for the PS4. This system really feels like its designed towards video games. Microsoft in my opinion lost the vision of being a \&quot;gaming console\&quot; by adding kinect and focusing on being an all in one system. Sony took a great direction with the PS4 and I am look forward to its future and games. Just remember their isn&#39;t a right side, it goes back on how you use your console and what you&#39;re looking out of it.For me the Playstation 4 fits my preference and use. It&#39;s at a great price, a good line of of exclusives, slightly better multi-platform games, overall a better value.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Xbox user who officially switched to PS4&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401321600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 29, 2014&quot;}</td>

This third unit, like the first, randomly subtracted 51 minutes from my elapsed time during the middle of a 3.5 hour run.  My last unit locked up anytime I tried to navigate and crashed during my last 100 miler, making it unusable for the last 50 miles.  With this, my THIRD Fenix2 unit in three months, I have never had a single week of training without a glitch, dropped sensors, lockups, dropped breadcrumb trail or the like.  Perhaps 4th time&#39;s a charm?  The only thing less reliable than the watch is Garmin&#39;s tech support, who continually says \&quot;wow, we&#39;ve never heard of that happening before.\&quot;  Bullpucky.  The forums are littered with people with tons of problems and no love from Garmin.  This watch is a joke.  A mean one.------------PRIOR REVIEW:  I&#39;ve had it less than a month, and and had no fewer than eight unique and serious lockup or totally whacky failures with it. I will note that if I do an activity for an hour or two, no issues. It&#39;s when you `push&#39; the thing on a 4/5/6+ hour run that it fails in some manner more times than not. Here&#39;s an example of what you too can experience on a long run, which is what happened to me on my 100k trail race (running) yesterday, even with Garmin&#39;s &#39;stable&#39; v2.9 update:1. Around an hour and fifty minutes (1:50), the heart rate monitor and the footpod were lost. This is a common occurrence with this watch.2. About 30 min later, the entire watch locked up. While running (during the race, damnit), I pressed and held the light key to shut it off, then on again. When it came back on, the HR and footpod were reading again, and the elapsed race time seemed to be about right.3. The HR and footpod worked the rest of the race, but the next issue was so totally ridiculous that I&#39;m still a bit in shock: when the elapsed time on the watch would get up to about 3:30, it would then drop down something around 2:15, and then continue to add time until the mid-three hour point, then, and I saw it with my own eyes, drop down to the low two hour point. It continued to do this cycle the entire 11 hours I was racing. I am seriously not making this up. I have pictures and video to prove it from the end of the race (because seriously, no one runs 100k/62 miles with 12k feet in elevation gain in under 5 hours), but that&#39;s what this ridiculous watch reported in the elapsed time field.4. The map page showed an arrow where I was, but... no track laid down. Nothing. Which kinda made it useless for navigating.Summary: $400 fitness GPS watch that cannot consistently report back on fitness, doesn&#39;t function as a GPS, and apparently can&#39;t even be relied on as a stopwatch.From what I&#39;ve seen, I really do think you need to be doing 3+ hour runs (or whatever) to see the consistent, regular failures of this thing. If all you do is train for one or two hours (which is fine, that&#39;s not a judgment), then it might work for you. Maybe.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Serious endurance athletes: DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399766400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 11, 2014&quot;}</td>

I use it for streaming radio while walking around and answering the occasional phone call.  It works very well for this.Pros:Long battery life.Very comfortable (often times forget I&#39;m wearing them).The sound is clear and does not drop out.Switching from music to phone call, back to music works without issue.Buttons are easily accessible while in use.Cons:The volume control on the device is not fine enough and was almost a deal breaker.  At level 0 it is silent and level 1 can be too loud at times.  I now use an app called Fine Volume Control V2 from the Android store that allows me to adjust between 0 - 1.  I think this is an Android issue vs a problem with the design of the headset.  You&#39;ll need to use the software to &amp;#34;fine tune&amp;#34; the volume and not the hardware buttons.  This took a little getting used to but now I&#39;m used to it.  I combined this app with a profile app (Locale) so when my phone detects a connection with these headphones, the volume is automatically adjusted to my desired volume level.The magnets for holding the ear-buds while not in use are not that strong.  It&#39;s easy for them to disconnect.When I use it for voice activated dialing, it has a problem understanding me.  It rarely gets the phone number correct.  This is not a problem with other Bluetooth headsets I&#39;ve owned in the past.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I like this device&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1388966400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

I give the enclosure four stars because it does work the way it is supposed to per their documentation.  I can&#39;t give it five stars without some improvements.The first disappointment was expected based on other reviews.  The enclosure is not made to be reopened.  However, the first enclosure I received would not charge.  After talking to Macally Technical and Customer support I returned the enclosure and received a new one, which works perfectly.  But most important, since I wanted to remove my drive before returning the enclosure, I found that if you are careful you can open the enclosure without breaking it!  I wouldn&#39;t do it more than once, though.The second bit of disappointment isn&#39;t Macally&#39;s fault.  My iTunes library is almost 1TB and I had considered using this enclosure with a 1TB drive as my iTunes drive.  That idea works OK with my Macbook Pro, but it won&#39;t work with my iPhone or iPad because of the way iTunes stores files on the i-devices.  So instead I have two folders on this drive.  One contains my favorite MP3s and the other movies that do not have DRM.  This format works with the i-devices using the Macally iOS app.  I don&#39;t store documents on this drive because I find that the cloud (I use a few but primarily Dropbox) works for that purpose.The last bit of disappointment is the ethernet port.  It would be nice if this port had some real use.  However, it serves one purpose and that is to use the enclosure as a Wifi hot spot.  You connect the ethernet port to whatever Internet access you have, say in your hotel room when traveling, and you now have a hotspot.  Since I already use my iPhone as a hot spot when I travel, primarily to avoid the ridiculous rates hotels charge, I don&#39;t see the purpose.  But my disappointment is that an ethernet connection should be faster than the USB 3.0 one for transferring files.  However, the ethernet port can&#39;t be used for transferring files.  The drive does not operate as a NAS drive while connected this way.  This isn&#39;t really surprising considering the price.One comment on the provided Mac app.  When I first installed the app on my Macbook Pro, the app would not connect to the drive.  After some major frustration I discovered the problem (not documented) was that my Macbook Pro was ethernet attached to my home network, and I could not have both that connection and the Macally drive connected via WiFi at the same time.  Disconnecting the ethernet cable from my laptop solved this problem.  Since I use the drive for my i-devices this isn&#39;t a problem for me.  The app is used to customize the drives WiFi settings and that is all I have used it for.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Does what it is advertised to do&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395100800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

For a camera with a sensor this size, it handles noise surprisingly well. I don&#39;t use flash much but the pop up flash is a nice option.The only thing I&#39;d knock this camera for would be the menu system is clunky and sometimes the auto focus while quick, doesn&#39;t seem very intuitive.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;overall&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">4.0</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;summary&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Surprised by Samsung<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;unixReviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">1401840000</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;reviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>06 4, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

I&#39;ve used Apple computers since the year 2000 (or so) for graphic design and audio production, and definitely fell for their marketing games and bought almost every Apple product available.About this battery charger, it works great! I actually have two of these. The batteries inside my wireless mouse, wireless keyboard and wireless trackpad last for not less than 2 weeks, and I don&#39;t turn off my devices (sometimes my iMac computers go for a straight week turned on).An honest advice would be to evaluate other options. I bought this because I love everything apple; this thing has the aesthetics that match my entire computer rig. The batterries aren&#39;t the most powerful ones around, but I remember a couple of times that I had to use them with a LED portable light to record some night footage with my camera, and I was surprised that they lasted for 3 hours (they didn&#39;t run out of energy, I simply ended my gig).If you like Apple products and don&#39;t care about paying a few extra bucks, go for this product. Remember that there are some better options around for the same price, or even cheaper options!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great product!

One thing you have to do is go back to the Lenovo drivers site for it in &amp;#34;support&amp;#34; on the Lenovo website and do all the 8.1 driver updates as soon as you update it.

Greene&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [3, 3], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;First of all, this is a well-made, high quality tablet. Display quality is sharp and colors are vivid.  It has the full Windows 8.1 operating system, not Windows RT, which means you can load regular Windows software just like a regulars Windows 8.1 desktop or laptop computer.  It boots up quickly, apps and programs load very fast.  With an OTG cable, you can connect USB devices such as a thumb drive or wireless mouse.  You can also connect larger peripherals as well such as as an external hard driver or DVD player (though you will probably need a powered USB hub for the large devices such as these, as the tablet&#39;s internal power isn&#39;t sufficient.).  Microsoft Office Student and Teacher edition is included at no extra cost, making this a great little computer that you can actually do real work with while on the go.That&#39;s the good.  Now for the bad.  Putting it simply, many of the Windows 8 apps are just plain terrible, lacking in key features.  Take the Kindle app for Windows 8, for example.  I can only download my Kindle books, not Kindle periodicals or magazines.  C&#39;mon, Amazon, you can do better than that.  My whole purpose for having a Kindle app on a tablet is so that I can read magazines in color and look a the pictures i.e. have a more traditional magazine reading experience.  I don&#39;t read books on my Kindle app.  I have my dedicated Kindle e-reader for that purpose.  I can download magazines to my Android tablet as well as my Ipod touch.  Other apps, such as the Fox News app for Windows 8, look like they were just thrown together as an afterthought.  When I open a video in Fox News, it causes Internet explorer to boot up side by size, cutting the screen size of the app in half, presenting a disjointed experience.  What&#39;s up with that? I find myself ignoring the app all together and just accessing the Fox News web site.  I could go on.  So, my beef is not with the tablet, or Windows 8 per se, but with the writers of the apps for this platform.  Maybe these apps will improve over time, but for now, I won&#39;t be putting my old Android tablet up for sale on Ebay anytime soon.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Very nice tablet.  Many Windows 8 apps are lacking in key features&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391472000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

Since removing these from the network/power configuration I have had no more Circuit breaker issues.

I have a prehistoric 7-8 year old Dell Dimension E510 desktop that is super slow. So, I made the decision to buy a laptop under $400 yet still faster than my desktop.I set my eyes on this laptop from a local electronics store. I compared specs, from the size and weight, to the nitty features like the number of USBs. And so, here I have it.Let&#39;s start off with the design.The design of this notebook is, well, plastic. However, it isn&#39;t cheap plastic. The materials used are actually pretty good for its price point. The notebook is nice and rounded around the corners and the thickness of this notebook is about one inch. Now, most notebooks for this price point would be much thicker...Around 1.3in-1.4in, but Dell managed to squeeze everything in 1 inch. This is pretty darn good considering the tools this notebook provides. On the left side of the computer you have a headphone/microphone jack, 3 USB (2 USB 3.0) (1 USB 2.0), Ethernet, HDMI cable, and a power outlet. On the left side you have the optical drive and one more USB port (2.0). So the total amount of USBs this notebook has is 4. 4 USB ports, 2 of which are 3.0. USB 3.0 is relatively new for the market, and this allows much quicker transfer speeds compared to the 2.0s. However, most computers at this price point do not have USB 3.0s, or if they do, it would only be one or two. But keep in mind that this notebook has 4 USB ports. And at this price point, most if not all computers only have about 2 or 3. The optical drive is also a neat feature. For a 1 inch laptop that has an optical drive is pretty impressive considering the price. Most notebooks that are 1 inch or less usually skip the optical drive. Now, the bad thing about the thinness of this notebook is that it does not have a VGA port. You might need a HDMI to VGA port adapter for that. However, considering VGA&#39;s thickness and the thinness of notebooks that are coming out each year, VGA is bound to be obsolete due to the benefits of HDMI.On the interior, the notebook has a LARGE track pad. And this is good especially when it is running on windows 8 (I&#39;ll get to that later).Below the track pad, there are two left and right buttons. These buttons feel and sound cheap but that is not to be unexpected. When running, the track pad get quite warm. You really can&#39;t fault the computer for this because this is a one inch notebook. Since the ram sticks are essentially below the track pad, prepare yourself to have warm fingers. The keyboard is an island style keyboard that are evenly spaced. The key travel is okay. After writing a 5-6 page essay. It&#39;s also got a 10 key number pad. However, I do wish that number lock had a tiny light located on the button like the caps lock does. As I&#39;m typing, I sometimes reach over to the number lock while attempting to backspace. One minor complaint is keyboard flex towards the F8-F10 keys, not a big deal since these keys aren&#39;t often used. Also, like other reviewer have mentioned before. This computer has a sharp lip. As you are typing, the sharp lip is somewhat irritating. Doesn&#39;t hurt to take out a fine grit sand paper is smooth out that lip.Lastly, the spacing between the keys have a glossy finish. I notice that this attracts dust and requires occasional cleaning.As for the hardware,You get 500gb of storage but only 456gb of that storage is usable (the non-usable storage has to be used for the operating system. It runs on 4gb of ram and although it is sufficient, you may want to upgrade to 6 or 8 gigs of ram as you load more programs. But if you&#39;re an average web browser, 4 gigs is good enough. To just give you a idea at idle, it is using about 46% of the computers ram. The computer has one extra slot. [edit] The computer will accept 16gb of ram storage. I would suggest throwing in another 4gb as it will give you extra performance due to the dual channel configuration. After removing all the bloatware and Windows finally settled in after dozens of updates this notebook starts up well under a minute. Considering a startup to be when the computer starts to idle.-by the way, uninstall the additional trial anti-virus. Windows 8 already has Defender and so that antivirus will just eat up your resources, I think it comes with Kaspersky or McAfee-The operating system,Now, I&#39;m coming from Windows XP and 7, to be honest...Windows 8 is actually pretty cool. However, if you&#39;re an old geezer who likes the traditional interface, Win 8 probably wouldn&#39;t be a great option. Anyway, the big benefit of this laptop that allows you to enjoy Windows 8 without the use of a touch screen is the large track pad. This Dell has a 4 and 1/2 inch track pad and using multi gestures features makes it extremely easy.Of course, you can always disable the Windows 8 start up and have it behave like Windows 7. (Look up Windows 8 RetroUI) Other than that, the OS would definitely benefit with a touch screen but without it the system is still enjoyable.Battery life,On a full charge, I get around three to four hours of regular internet browsing.Now for the thinness of this laptop, this computer has a 4 cell battery vs the 6 cell that are in most laptops. Under intense radio loading such as streaming, it will drop to 2 hours...Maybe 3. Keep in mind; you do not want to torture your batteries. The lithium ion batteries used in modern laptops do not like to be charged and discharged abruptly as this will diminish battery life. But, I&#39;m willing to sacrifice 2 cells for a thinner and lighter laptop than have a big and heavy 6 cell.Screen:15.6 inches, 1366x768 glossy.Screen resolution isn&#39;t an issue here since most laptops--especially at this price point, have this type of resolution. The problem I commonly have is the viewing angles. This Dell uses a TNF panel, which is offers a distortion of colors when it isn&#39;t at the right angle.As for the glossy finish, well, it sucks. It still amazes me why computer corporations still use a glossy finish. The glossy finish and the bad viewing angles makes it somewhat of an unpleasant experience.The WLED screen is bright but the colors could use more saturation.Webcam:It is equipped with a 1 megapixel camera.After using Skype, the picture quality is pretty good.If I compared it with my other Lenovo G560 which has a 0.3 megapixel camera, the difference is like light and day.ProcessorOkay, so it doesn&#39;t have TurboBoost or 4-way processing.I have using an Intel Pentium Processor on a Lenovo notebook on Windows 7 and it&#39;s pretty good. It gets through most tasks however you must know your limitations.Considering the computers size, weight, and battery configuration, the processor is clocked at 1.9ghz on dual core. I have previously used a Pentium 4 @ 3GHz (a single core processor) and this laptop is significantly faster considering the dual core. Out of box, it scored a 4.7 on the Windows Experience Index. After everything got settled in with the way I liked it, it dropped to a 4.6. Using my way of testing the processor speed, I calculated Pi (Using SuperPi) to one million digits and it did it in 21 seconds. Not bad considering my Dell Desktop does it in 43 seconds... It handles HD streaming off YouTube without problems however when you stream in 720p you CPU usage hovers around 35-60%. Yet, doesn&#39;t give you a lot of room of other tasks.Gaming? Well, not much. Don&#39;t expect to play WoW or Crisis. It should handle basic games.This processor is equipped with Intel HD Ivy Bridge graphics. Very similar to Intel HD 2000.I was able to play RuneScape on the highest screen settings (other than full screen) with the use of their client rather than the browser. The CPU usage hovers around 80-90%. Game play was still smooth considering it is a 3D game. However, with 80-90% usage, again, does not leave much room for other tasks.Upgrades:The only upgrades you can do to this laptop is RAM and hard drive. The stock hard drive runs at 5400rpm and although it is pretty quick, a solid state would be pointless because you&#39;d be most likely dissatisfied with SSD&#39;s price and storage (until they get cheaper). If 500gb is too little, a 7200 rpm hard drive won&#39;t hurt.The computer comes with 4gb of ram. Although this is sufficient for basic tasks, it isn&#39;t configured as dual channel. Filling that extra DIMM slot will give you better memory storage as well as graphics performance. So why not do it?The CPU/Processor--unfortunately, cannot be upgraded. This is because it is a Ultra Low Voltage Processor (ULV) that is soldered onto the motherboard. This is a big down side since later down the road, you can&#39;t upgrade to a used processor at a significantly low price.It&#39;s portable, offers a large track pad, good keys, and is loaded with 4 USBs and an optical drive @ just one inch. Overall, this is a great laptop but I wouldn&#39;t consider this to be a everyday user. (I use it as a primary since I&#39;m coming from a prehistoric computers, in fact this computer is twice as fast than my old desktop) The processor is the caveat. If you have the option, go for their higher end \&quot;i Series\&quot; of Intel Core Processors.-UPDATE-I reran the Windows Experience Index (WEI) and it jumped from a 4.6 to a 5.1. I guess Windows obtained a better score after removing bloatware and installing the latest drivers. Additionally, a dual channel RAM configuration will allow a slight bump in graphics performance.So here are the subscores that the WEI came up with:Processor: 5.9Memory (RAM): 7.7 &amp;lt;-- I upgraded to 8gbGraphics: 4.6 to 5.1 &amp;lt;-- Graphics performance increases due to a 8gb dual channel configuration, Base score determined by lowest subscore.Gaming graphics: 6.2Primary hard disk: 5.9The WEI scores are based on a scale of 1.0-9.9-Update 2-This would probably fall under build quality. Earlier today I found a missing screw lying on my desk when plugging the notebook for charging. It turns out that this screw was one of the missing screws that was attached to the bottom of the notebook. I was thinking, \&quot;lucky me, good thing I didn&#39;t lose it\&quot;. So I screwed it back and, and while I was at it I went ahead and checked the rest of the screws. It turns out that all of the screws were not secured tightly (about 2-3 rotations loose). Although they had blue loctite on them, it was not firmly screwed on. Keep in mind, I did not touch any of these screws other than the RAM slot panels which were already secured. I don&#39;t know if it just my computer or an entire batch, but a simple production step like secured screws worries me.I would drop a star off my rating (3 stars), but I&#39;m relatively satisfied with my purchase.-Update 3-Running Windows 8.1! The transition was almost flawless except that there was a program I had to uninstall (w/ a little difficulty).Windows 8.1 makes the non-touch situation seem more enjoyable.Couple of complaints is that the two finger tap stopped functioning even after installing the latest drivers designed specifically for 8.1. Sleep functions seems to be a hit and miss as well. Windows 8 slept fine, but 8.1 won&#39;t sleep when the computer idles. While searching around the internet, this seems to be a fault by Microsoft and not Dell.If you can live through those gripes, upgrade to 8.1.-Update 4-Now running Windows 8.1 Update 1 (8.1.1). Microsoft added several features that makes Win8 more barable with a keyboard and mouse. Highly reccomended if you already updated to 8.1, get the Update 1.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Good value (w/ Win8 is more bearable with 8.1.1)&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400716800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 22, 2014&quot;}</td>

McLane \&quot;Mike\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;I was so excited to bring my old triports back from the dead. the original bose pads had disbonded, releasing the inner cushion out of the leatherette as well as become flaky as the other reviewers talk about. I recently discovered this is a replaceable part and was so happy to put my headphones back to work.I received these in 2 days, and quickly got to fitting them. There is an insulative foam on the plastic ring that makes it too fat to fit under the clips on the headphone chassis. No problem. I removed the thickness and the plastic ring left behind was almost exactly the same thickness as the originals. After making this modification, I lined up the connection, and there was about 1/8&amp;#34; of hard plastic sticking out past the edge of the headphone chassis.Basically, you can get 3/4 of the perimeter clipped in, as the spare material piles up and will not go into place. I need to remove a ring of plastic from around the entire circumference of the replacement pads. I have not been able to do it yet, but i need to take a fingernail clippers and probably a small file and remove this material from the entire earpads.I am assuming that i can hack these and make them work, but not without at least one hour of work. The fitment is completely wrong, and that makes this bargain much more hassle that it is worth. If you are going to produce cheap knockoffs to capitalize on the replacement parts market, at least trace the original better. I expect that this pad was made for some other bose headphones with a bit different dimensions. For me to have to modify the thickness as well as the circumference is just too far from the original.Most likely, they sold me something designed for the QC line or some other bose headphones... though i ordered the TP-1 unit and it was packaged and labled as the TP-1 unit. I would literally not buy another bluecell product in my life.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Completely the wrong size. do not bother if you have the TP-1 model approx 8 years old&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391731200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

I figured digital always meant better, but I guess that&#39;s not always the case.  The range is surprisingly good.  Bass is obviously excellent with 50mm drivers, but I was surprised by the simultaneous high-frequency quality.  I&#39;ve had some cans that could rock the bass, but couldn&#39;t carry high-notes well at the same time.  These apparently do both very well.One thing to note:  If you are using on-board audio, there is a good chance you won&#39;t get the volume level you want.  I came across that problem, and noticed some sound distortion at 100% volume (due to the on-board audio stressing itself).  I took a chance with the Sound Blaster Z SBX, and OH MY GOD.  The marriage of these 2 items is heaven on eardrum.If you get these, there are best suited for use with a dedicated audio card, but are still very good without if you need to use them without.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Exceptional audio quality, and great mic&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390608000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 25, 2014&quot;}</td>

I replaced a 1950&#39;s television antenna with this model.  This location is a significant distance from the tv translators.  The antenna is approximately 25 feet above ground level, on a mast.  I run new RG6 cable in to building, and then split to two different tvs.  Did the channel scan and every channel 70 - 95% signal, without any amplifier.. This was impressive, as most of their channels were not pulling 20% before.  This being both UHF and VHF, it&#39;s covering both digital bands for today.  They couldn&#39;t be happier.  Antenna appears to be of good solid quality.  This install is much farther away from the tv transmit towers than what this antenna is rated for.  All the tv transmitters are located in same location, so once this one was aimed it covered them all.  That is something to keep in mind what doing an antenna.. You may have many located around you in different directions.. When you can get a quality antenna like this, in this smaller size, there is no reason to buy anything bigger or more expensive.  Our cable run wasn&#39;t too long, so we chose to not do an amp.. With the signal&#39;s in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s % saw no reason for it..  I would recommend this antenna to anyone looking for a good quality antenna.  Just remember this antenna mounts on mast in the center of antenna body.. You need to be able to have an open mast, like above a roof for this to mount right.. Channel master makes an edge mount antenna, so you can mount antenna on like a dish tv mount on a side of a structure...&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;- Excellent antenna for Rural Location&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399075200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

I do quite a bit of facetime with my overseas relatives and friends, I used to grab a whole stack of hardcover books to elevate my phone so the other party could see me while I was sitting on the couch with the coffee table in front of it.

I try to use cooling liquid made for water cooling systems (anti-corrosion/anti-microbial, etc.) but I did have a water block get an algae bloom for an unknown reason a few years ago; so the silver was extra insurance against algae and microorganisms.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;overall&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">5.0</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;summary&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Great<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;unixReviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">1403568000</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;reviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>06 24, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

Just be aware of the various capabilities of various apps.* I&#39;ve solved the problem of getting video to my TV in a lot of different ways but this one falters because the cable is just too short.  Maybe 4 feet.  I tend to sit further away than that so this is pretty useless to me.In summary, it does get video to the TV from an iPhone 4.

When it freezes (or has the refresh button stuck in the middle of the page) the remote becomes useless and you have to physically unplug the system and plug it back in.For some video the audio is not synchronized(though it wouldn&#39;t be for VLC), but this is fixable through the options menu to skip ahead or behind by 100ms.  Though sometimes when you adjust the player freezes and restart must occur.Unless I get a decent response back on my case number (#071214-8706588) from WD I plan on returning it and just finding a small form fitting cpu with hdmi out and vlc player.Was hoping Chromecast would work, but it doesn&#39;t really do local file playing very well (used allcast and the stream seemed to take up all the RAM on the router rendering the internet connection ineffective).  Also had to worry about the frame-rate/quality being too high.My blu-ray player does pretty much the same thing, \&quot;supports\&quot; file formats then fails to play anything.  *slow clap*&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Freezes&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1405123200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 12, 2014&quot;}</td>

Although tedious to program a recording, it&#39;s a great little device to watch TV with. Not only will it convert ATSC signals, but it also provides an HDMI and component output with excellent picture quality. However, on the down side, the remote is very awkward to use, often requiring several key presses to do a simple task-very tedious. Remote operation can lock up and it&#39;s functions are not intuitive. It often fails to record as scheduled, and sometimes it will stop recording after a few minutes, while at other times, it records as planned. I&#39;ve tried various recording media with the same result. I&#39;ve also tried two HomeWorx units and they share the same faults and attributes. I returned the Viewtv unit and may do the same with the HomeWorx units. These different brands also seem to share the same electronics which may explain why I experienced the same characteristics with both brands. Now, other features that are hard to deal with: A 24 hour clock; Recording names are by date and time only, not the show&#39;s name; Odd, remote function names that make for awkward use. And finally, this could be a five star device if the remote and other soft spots were corrected. All considered though, this is still a very useful piece of equipment.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Erratic operation&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399248000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 5, 2014&quot;}</td>

What I didn&#39;t realize is how awesome the EOS-M and an FD lens + adaptor would be. I have an FD adaptor for my other EF mount cameras which uses an optical element in the adaptor to enlarge the image due to the fact that the adaptor moves the lens further from the sensor. This can of course degrade or distort the image. Because the EOS-M has a shorter flange distance and needs to move any EF, EF-S or FD lens further away from the sensor anyway so this adaptor does not need the optical element.If you want to shoot video with your EOS-M then you might already be willing to pay $100s for a lens with a &amp;#34;de-clicked&amp;#34; aperture and manual focus. It&#39;s fairly easy to de-click many of the FD lens&#39;s and with this adaptor you can start using old and in expensive FD lenses for manual video. My 50mm looks great, though you will want to add a variable ND filter if you want to shoot wide open in bright light.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Perfect for video&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389830400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

The camera can not judge what you are thinking so you must make the proper settings when composing the picture.

I&#39;m really in love with theVIZIO 40-Inch 1080p Smart LED HDTVbecause it meets an outstanding value in terms of features when compared to price.First things first, the TV has amazing aesthetics.  The Vizio features a super slim bezel, that means I&#39;m looking at more TV space and less plastic surround.  1080P in this price range is not too easy to find so another score there.  Much better 120Hz refresh rate, my old one had only 60Hz.  LED is fantastic, and energy saving, much more vibrant than LCD too.  Love the 10,000,000:1 contrast, a tremendous upgrade to 10,000:1 dynamic my older model used.Getting into the users experience, the Vizio 40\&quot; is a good size for the bedroom, office, or smaller living room.  Love the built-in Wi-Fi for connectivity to all the apps in the Vizio store.  I wish this model had a built-in web browser, but I have a tablet that is great for that.  If you use and subscribe to Netflix, the TV remote has a dedicated button directly to the service.  In terms of connectivity, you have 3 HDMI ports for your gaming stations, DVD/Blu-Ray player, sound system or whatever else you may use.The picture quality is really amazing; clear, crisp and wonderful.  Sound is really good, the 2 10W speakers are powerful and full sounding.  This TV gives new meaning to entertainment center.  Such a good value.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A Nice TV, With Great Specs...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394928000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

The ARM cpu based units have the battery life but not the speed, and models like the C710 have the older intel cpu with good speed, but short battery life.  One thing the C710 has is some amount of upgrade potential but it requires a pretty heavy disassembly process.  This unit can&#39;t really be upgraded.Its thin, light, has a good enough screen and as long as you&#39;re okay with doing stuff in a chrome browser or with google apps, its a fully functional lightweight laptop.

The security isn&#39;t top notch but it isn&#39;t bad and they are way easy to set up and use with the mobile app.  I like them.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;overall&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">5.0</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;summary&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Great cameras.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;unixReviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">1403740800</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;reviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>06 26, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

Logitech did a good job copying the Apple Magic Trackpad (I have both). It works well, tracking easily, and the left/right click functions work as you&#39;d expect. The ONE glitch I see now and then though is when the cursor starts to move slowly...really slowly, like you&#39;re dragging it through mud. I usually turn the trackpad off and back on to fix this. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s causing it - might be RF interference, I do have the receiver in the dock and up on my desk away from the computer (but still close).The battery life as good as the Apple Magic Trackpad, but it&#39;s good enough to last a couple of weeks, and it&#39;s easy to recharge with any microUSB cable and charger, so two thumbs up here from me.This is a great solution for people with RSI issues who want to free themselves from the &amp;#34;death clutch&amp;#34; of a traditional mouse. I have several of these and use them on every computer station I have.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Solid Product With One Weird Flaw&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399939200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 13, 2014&quot;}</td>

Long&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;The Sony XBAH3 Hybrid&#39;s are a great all around headphone. The first thing you will notice is that these in-ears are huge. Thanks to a 16mm bass driver, the casing is larger than any other in-ear I have ever tried. They sort of stick out of your ear at a weird angle. The thing is, though, these are some great sounding headphones.The large bass driver does not overpower the balanced armature drivers. Treble is silky smooth, reminding me quite a bit of the classic Sennheiser sound. Mid&#39;s are present and not over powering. I&#39;ve thrown a lot of different music at these things over the past month, and I&#39;ve been consistently pleased with the sound.The cords are a strange beast. They have a very thick and semi flexible ear loop. Once you get them molded to your ears, they tend to remain in place. If you wear glasses, the thick cables will be in the way.Changing the headphones for the microphone cable is a pain. Once you change the wires, you have to make them mold to your ears again. The headphones come with a nice variety of Sony tips. You even get a set that are dampened. It&#39;s fun to change the tips in and out as you search for the perfect fit and sound.Overall these are some pretty amazing headphones if you can put up with the quirky cords.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great everyday headphones&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403740800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

I&#39;ve installed 20+ radios, and this was easy and straight forward.  This was the cheapest and fit my purposes.  My only complaint was notiable engine noise comes through the radio, which is usually indicitabe of a cheap amp and/or poor grounding (wirring sound from alternator action).  Otherwise it sounded fine, and radio tuning seemed fine.  If it played WMA&#39;s I&#39;d consider installing on a mower or other recreational type craft, just to have cheap radio.  But for those wishing to upgrade their factory stuffs, this one will give you the aux in your looking for but thats about it, no superior sound quality.  Wiring was simple, this is 1/2 the depth of a standard radio.  Has SD slot, USb, and aux in, and standard radio fetures, and looks decent, though nob feels a little cheap.  Served my purpose.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Ok radio with good number of inputs, but poor grounding / cheap amp causes alternatior / engine noise through speakers.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404691200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

I had concerns about the sound quality of most of the items on the market but have always valued Sony products so I thought I would give these a shot.To my delight, they provide outstanding reproduction.  The sound is crisp, clear and rich.  What we fail to realize is that today&#39;s TV and DVD content is loaded with detailed sound.  Speakers, no matter how good, are dissipating the sound throughout the room.  Detail is inevitably missed.  As with music, headphones make a huge difference for TV and video.  These are very comfortable to wear.  The setup took about 30 seconds and the charge seems to last plenty long.Even though these are discontinued and an older model, they are great and I urge anyone to order them without delay, if, and it is a big if,  your receiver, cable box, dvr or other source has a digital optical audio output.  These headphones have only one digital setup option:  optical cable.  Most new receivers no longer have an optical audio output.  My great 2 year old Denon receiver didn&#39;t.I couldn&#39;t even find a new higher end A/V receiver to buy that had an optical audio output.  I feared that I was going to have to set the phones up using analog connections which I really did not want to do.Then I had an inspiration to look at the back of my TIVO Premiere XL.  Sure enough, it had an optical output.  The Sony transmitter connected immediately and the sound was perfect.  Better still, the Sony headphones set up this way operate independently of theTV audio simultaneously coming out of my Denon receiver.  The volume of each can be controlled independently and there is no delay between the two audio tracks.  Perfect!Sony&#39;s new model of this item comes with an HDMI connection making life much easier.  However, those phones are more that $400 even on Amazon.  I usually spare no expense but that number gave me some pause as I had no idea what the sound quality would be using those phones.  The MDRDS6500 worked out perfectly.  Check for that optical output and buy these while they are still available!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Outstanding Wireless Headphones--with one big caveat&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398384000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 25, 2014&quot;}</td>

This is one of those times and that&#39;s the beauty of it. I&#39;m willing to pay for all those engineering hours that went into making a product that just works.Why only 4 stars? Sirius does drop out every now and then. And I do wish Sonos was clearer about how the Connect fits into the picture. I would have bought this a lot earlier and saved myself a lot of time playing around with other solutions.There seems to be a lot of marketing and instructions regarding the Sonos Play devices, but not much about this one. For example, I had thought using Sonos would require me to ditch my current audio system and move completely to their speakers because pretty much every solution they showed had a few of those Sonos speakers sprinkled in. Also, I wish they had it in black so that it blended in better with my other audio equipment.I had a few questions about the system and my local Best Buy guys couldn&#39;t answer them. I could tell they were just making up stuff and hoping I wouldn&#39;t ask more questions. For example, they were convinced I needed a bridge (wrong) and that the Connect was basically a router and that I would need a computer on at all times in order to make this work (also wrong).So, I emailed Sonos directly (they have their email listed on the Support section of their website). Within a few hours I had the answers I needed to make my decision. That&#39;s good customer service right there- I wasn&#39;t yet a customer, and yet they were very prompt about helping me make the right choices. Sonos didn&#39;t try to sell me things I didn&#39;t need. Very impressive.My current setup:-Pioneer Elite SC-75 receiver-Martin Logan EM-ESL speakers-Dynamo 700 sub-MyCloud (all my music files are on the MyCloud) connected via Ethernet cable directly to the router-Sonos Connect (without the amp feature because I use wired speakers to my Pioneer receiver)-I do not have any other Sonos components (no Bridge, no Sonos speakers, just the Connect only)-I do not leave a computer running to work with this system-My wireless router is right by the Sonos: the Connect is connected directly to the router by Ethernet cableThe questions I had were (paraphrased):Question:If I use my iPad to control the Connect music lists (kick off a playlist, play Sirius, etc.) does the iPad need to remain on if no music files are being used from it.Answer: All of the programming stays on the Connect itself. You can basically turn off the iPad completely and the Connect will work just fine once you&#39;ve started your music. You&#39;ll need to make sure if you are playing music files that the source for those files is accessible. So, if you do have your music on your iPad or computer, that needs to stay on so the Connect can access the files and play them.Question: I really like my DAC on the Pioneer Elite SC-75 and want to use it instead of the DAC in the Connect. How do I do that?Answer: If you use a digital optical cable out from the Connect and into the Pioneer, the signal remains digital and the DAC on the Pioneer will do the conversion.  If you use the RCA connectors out of the Connect and into the Pioneer, the signal is converted from digital to analog by the Connect DAC. The RCA cable was included. If you want to use digital optical, you&#39;ll need to buy one.Question: Do I need to buy a bridge?Answer: No. You can connect your Connect by using an Ethernet cable right to the router.As long as your controller software (in my case, the iPad) can communicate with the same network that the Connect is on, you&#39;re fine. You only need the bridge if you cannot connect your Connect directly to the router or if you need to communicate to other Sonos components (like Sonos speakers) that are not connected to the router via Ethernet. The controller (in my case, iPad) never communicates using the wireless connection that is used between the Bridge and the Sonos components. It just goes across the regular wireless that you have going on in your house. For me, I have the Connect plugged directly into my NightHawk wireless router and that&#39;s the same router that serves the wireless connection for my iPad. Works perfectly. And they do include the Ethernet cable right in the box.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;It just works!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389484800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 12, 2014&quot;}</td>

If you&#39;re looking for amazing sound quality and something you can drop in the pool and take to the beach... oh yeah, I also want it for under $100! Yeah, I would look elsewhere (you&#39;ll probably look for a long time too).I bought this for music by the pool (on the ledge) and on the boat (while floating around), it is perfect for those two things.Clearly the fact that its waterproof and can&#39;t have full sound ducts limits its low-end (bass) sound, but I&#39;m willing to trade off perfect sound for utility and endurance.Here are the great parts... the bluetooth is extremely easy to pair and the connection is solid (way better than a unit I had that was 3 times the price). I paired this thing with my iphone 5 and walked around the house and it never broke a connection. I know BT speakers/headsets that break when it&#39;s windy!You don&#39;t have to worry at all about this thing, it&#39;s great. You charge it, pair it and you have music in a localized area anywhere you want? Leave your phone in the house or below deck and control (skip tracks/ pause/take calls) above deck or poolside where it&#39;s wet and wild.I had very high overall expectations for this (but still skeptical about the sound because of the physical limitions e.g. size, mobility, ruggedness), but this thing is dead on what I need. It helps that its priced reasonably too!If you&#39;re going to be an audio snob, keep looking. Also, if you think this thing is going to be loud enough for a BBQ party with 30 people talking over it, you&#39;ll be disappointed too. if you&#39;re ok with some decent sounding tunes, this is an awesome/fun product!P.S. as a general rule I never try to let anything with a lithium-ion battery get extremely hot (cell phone, tablet, this thing, gps) so I try to keep it out of direct sun if I can, just to make the battery chemicals last longer. Take it out of the 107 degree car when you&#39;re not using it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Exactly what I was looking for.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401321600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 29, 2014&quot;}</td>

For this use case, I&#39;m calling the Sony AS100 the best action camera on the market because the image quality is great and the image stabilization works well. This is the only action camera that I have seen with built-in image stabilization and that feature makes a huge difference when bicycling. Even when bicycling on good quality roads, there are enough bumps to make the video unpleasant to watch without image stabilization. The in-camera image stabilization works great for me, giving me much better results than the Adobe Premier stabilization filter, which take forever to run in addition to producing unsatisfactory results.I have also used Sony&#39;s previous action camera, the AS30. That model also has image stabilization and generally works OK, but has enough quirks to make the total experience less than idea. Most importantly, the AS100 has noticeably improved image quality, with clearer images as well as better color and contrast. Some other improvements that I immediately noticed:1. With the AS30, the only way to tell if the camera was shooting is to look at the small LCD screen on the side of the camera, which is hard to do when you are riding your bicycle. The AS100 now has red LEDs on the top and back of the camera to easily tell your if the camera is shooting. This is a huge improvement for me. With the AS30, I missed many shots because I thought the camera was on when it was not.2. With the AS30, you have to put the camera in the clunky underwater case before attaching it to your bicycle or helmet. With the helmet mount, this can be uncomfortable because of the weight of the case. The AS100 now includes a lightweight, but still secure, holder for use with all mounts.3. In addition to reducing weight and bulk, this holder also lets you replace the camera battery without removing the camera from the case. You can also access the USB port (for downloading video and/or recharging) without removing the holder. Without the case, the camera is less protected, but that&#39;s not a big deal for my uses (the camera will probably become obsolete before I crash with it).4. Possibly because I&#39;m not longer using the waterproof case all the time, the AS100 camera lens seems to pick up much less glare than the AS30. With the AS30, shooting in the direction of the sun usually produced worthless videos because of glare. This no longer seems to be a problem with the AS100, at least so far.5. The AS30 already had great audio (for an action camera), but the AS100 is noticeably better. I notice much less wind noise with the Sony cameras than with other brands. The AS100 seems clearer to me with with regard to other audio input like conversations and bicycle mechanical sounds.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;best action camera if you want to mount on a bicycle handlebar&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398902400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

The screen is bright, with pleasant colors and no glare thanks to matte finish. The windshield mount is compact and easy to use. I like that you can download interfaces and voices in many different languages. The display showing speed limit next to my current speed is really handy. Once it&#39;s done calculating the route (which can take a while) It does a good job of navigation. That said, I&#39;ve been spoiled by Google&#39;s incredibly powerful navigation app on my phone, and this Garmin is just not in the same league. It can be fussy with address entry, and sometimes fails to find the destination even if I spell it fully. With Google app I can enter a partial address and it will figure out the rest, even correcting my typos. When I deviate from the suggested route, this Garmin seems to take too long to notice and re-calculate. Of course Google navigation requires an internet connection to do its tricks, so if I plan to travel where network coverage is poor, Garmin will be the tool of choice. But if you mostly drive in populated areas, Google navigation is far superior.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Nice unit, with some flaws&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391126400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 31, 2014&quot;}</td>

This system really does the job. The quality of the sound is great. I have Bose speakers in my home theater and although the Denon system does not have nearly as much wattage, the sound quality is comparable. This is not to say it is not loud enough. I don&#39;t know how high the volume level goes, but most of the time I listen to music at about 18 or 20. 25 is loud, 30 is rocking loud and 40 is high enough to hear the music with ear plugs and the table saw running. Not the cheapest bookshelf system, but certainly one of the best sounding.Just be aware you need at least a 10&amp;#34; wide shelf for the speakers and a 12&amp;#34; shelf for the receiver. My speakers are about six feet apart mounted on shelves about seven feet high and they sound fantastic.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Excellent system, small footprint&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401753600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

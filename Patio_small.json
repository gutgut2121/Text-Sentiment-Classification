The large dark brown bait stations our association has placed around the periphery of our buildings are a constant reminder that the rats which invaded even my own home a few years ago survive in this wooded suburban community.  I&#39;ve purchased the larger stations and our maintenance people keep them filled, so they are thrilled to have had an opportunity to try this one which is substantially smaller and way more attractive.  I placed this box behind my own building (of course) for our trial purposes and because I&#39;d heard from neighbors in the rear of this building that the rats had been seen.  Since the one person had sealed off the access points which allowed one to enter her home, I figured that would be the perfect spot.When this type of rat bait is used, it&#39;s not typical to find a rat coming back for more because they leave the station and then they die.  Another rat comes on over and has a taste and the same happens to him/her.  Since this station supposedly can kill 10 rats, unless you have a serious infestation, you will not see the bait disappear overnight.  There is so much to consider when attempting to rid your home or business of vermin, and I suggest not making a hasty decision.  For example, the last thing you&#39;d want, I&#39;m sure, is to have your victims crawl to and die somewhere inside your walls.  The decomposition is nasty if the source of an odorous situation cannot be located or accessed.  So, seal off access points and then go for the kill.  I like this station and look forward to having it emptied.  I&#39;ve asked the maintenance guys to move it to the next building in a couple weeks if bait remains.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;It is bait and when rats eat it, they die where they are, not usually at the station&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403827200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 27, 2014&quot;}</td>

Well, I will say it again, PERFECTION!  I was a bit skeptical at the ability of an electric grill being able to perform as a propane or charcoal grill could but I have eaten my doubt and words.Product arrives in a big box but is actually rather compact; this is because there is no base for the grill to sit on.  That base cart can be purchased as an accessory.  I have always taken issue with the fact that Weber makes you purchase this cart separately.  For a little bit more they should just include it with your original purchase.I wish that we could have used this grill outside but since we have been dealing with the &amp;#34;POLAR VORTEX&amp;#34; for the last month there has never been a warm or dry enough day to sit on the balcony grilling while dreaming of a NY steamy summer.  We opted to grill inside and I will be the first to warn you against doing this UNLESS you have previously done this and understand that there will be a lot of smoke and you will have the smell of street cart vendor stuck to everything on your body!  We set up an air machine, ceiling fan and opened a few windows on this frigid day (21 degrees) and grilled.  There was the mandatory 20 min pre-heat prep for proper searing and temperature regulation.  This wasn&#39;t an issue as I took the time to prepare our meal and prep the pork belly and pork chops.The grill heats up quickly and evenly.  I assumed that the metal dome top would steam everything rather than provide a true sear to anything.  I was extremely surprised when all the chops including the pork belly came out beautifully seared and the fat on the pork belly was perfectly charred to our liking.  It was so QUICK!!  Honestly it was quicker than our infrared propane grill on the balcony that we use during the summer.  You have to keep the lid down and this effectively cooks everything quickly and provides the right amount of heat combined with the awesome grates.A tiny issue is that cooking surface is a bit small.  We had to cook everything in 3 batches.  Again, the grill is super quick!  There were two pork bellies and 2 odd shaped chops that would fit at a time.  If you need a better example: Imagine 6 center cut boneless chops; that is what you can grill at one time on the small surface.  Depending on what we are preparing it is not enough space for a family of five.Clean-up is pretty simple and straight-forward.  The grates soak in the sink and then can be wiped clean with your sponge.  You will not need any scouring pads or harsh barbecue brushes.  The bottom bowl located beneath the heating element that catches all the grease/juices is also simple to clean.  Pop out and wash.  This has been the easiest grill we have ever had to clean.Highly recommend for apartment dwellers that are not allowed because of board rules, landlords or city regulations to have a gas or charcoal grill on their patio, balcony or outdoor space.  This item was made for big cities and any New Yorker would love one.  At first I balked at the price thinking that it would be exactly like a George Foreman, but after trying it out I truly believe that it is worth every penny.  I just wish that they would include the cart.  We simply placed it on top of our washer/dryer.  It was smoky but it is even that way when we grill outside on our balcony.  I would also recommend for the consumer that does not want to deal with charcoal or the constant change of propane tanks.  This is as simple as it can get and your family or guests will most likely not be able to tell the difference.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Q140... electric perfection!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393372800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

I don&#39;t know if that is why some of the reviewers waterers are emptying out their water. Mine holds its water like it should.The waterer is made of a rather low-grade plastic which seemed flimsy when assembling.  So far I&#39;ve seen finches and one hummingbird use it. I&#39;m a little apprehensive about larger birds, such as red-winged blackbirds, using it because the \&quot;base bottom\&quot; that the birds stand on seems especially flimsy.So far it&#39;s working like it&#39;s supposed to.

The problem was more that the machining had virtually no tolerance, and it thus required a lot of hand strength at several points to get the thing put together.  Second: though the electrical ground fault tester indicated that there was not a problem and though we tried plugging the device into several different outlets, we could not get the motor to turn on.  We followed all the fail safe hints and suggestions.  But: no go.We will try taking the device over to the more modern house of friends to see whether the problem is a function of our old house and old electrical service or something in the device itself.

Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There&#39;s a door on the front, seems intuitive, but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I&#39;m slow, but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab.

My hydrangeas have never gotten beyond 3 feet tall until I started using a deer/rabbit repellent.  The deer always browsed the new growth so the plants looked healthy but no flowers.  Since this is a vacation house, I&#39;m not there to chase off the deer.  We have security cameras so I&#39;ve seen the footage of the deer going to the bushes &amp; walking away.  I used to have footage of the deer enjoying my bushes.It is rain &amp;#34;resistant&amp;#34; &amp; it did last through a couple rain storms in the two weeks after I applied it  although it had definitely washed off some of it.  I reapplied it just to be sure.  The 30-day claim is perhaps a bit optimistic unless there has been very little or no rain.  You also need to reapply to any new growth because it will not have the nasty flavor on it to deter the deer/rabbits from snacking.It does have an odor until it dries but it is less noticeable than similar products I&#39;ve used.  It&#39;s not very offensive; just a cinnamon/clove scent with the rotten eggs/vinegar.This is an expensive option for deer repellant.  I really don&#39;t think it should cost this much considering  the ingredients are not unusual.  Using this with a hose is also kind of messy &amp; maybe more wasteful than other products that don&#39;t require a hose.  I think the &amp;#34;concentrate&amp;#34; form would be a better choice.  However, if you use the concentrate, you need to run fresh water through the sprayer after using it or you will get clogs from the &amp;#34;rain resistant&amp;#34; ingredients.

Let&amp;#8217;s start with the good:1. It&amp;#8217;s amazingly bright, for a solar-powered system.  Anyone who has installed the old-style solar powered outdoor lights knows that they are bright enough to show people where the lights are, but not exactly useful in providing actual illumination.  The d.light system isn&#39;t as bright as an incandescent bulb (or a CF, for that matter), but it does a reasonable job of lighting the area.  And since the cords between the lights and the controllers are long, you can spread them out to light a wider area or mass them to create more intense light.2. The lights are individually controlled and each one has a high power/low power option, so you can decide for yourself how to choose between brightness and the length of time your system will function without a recharge.3. The system is advertised as providing light for a long time.  One light on low power operates for 15 hours.  Operating both lights high power, the system operates for 3.5 hours.  But even that is a pretty long time if, for instance you are lighting a cabin, tent or garden shed.  Also, the lights glowed brightly even with just a couple of hours of sun.4. It is simple to install; all you need is a drill and screwdriver to install the 10 screws.  The instructions consist of three pictures and about that many some self-evident sentences. But that&amp;#8217;s all you need.The flaws are minor, but  worth mentioning:1. It&amp;#8217;s fairly pricey.  At $185, this system is worthwhile only if it&amp;#8217;s going to last a while. Otherwise, you are better off hanging an LED-powered flashlight with rechargeable batteries from the ceiling. The system is guaranteed for two years, but since this is a new product, there&amp;#8217;s no telling how long it will actually last.2. There is no mounting hardware. One would think that it would not be too difficult for the manufacturer to add the include screws to fasten the solar panel, the four screws to attach the two controllers and the two screws for the lights. It also wouldn&#39;t be too difficult to include cable staples to hold the wires in place, which are conveniently pictured in the instructions but inconveniently not included in the package. Did I mention that the system is pricey?On the whole, this is a good product for lighting a shed, exterior garage or a one-room summer cabin.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Get Off the Grid&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400025600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 14, 2014&quot;}</td>

Colonna&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;I have used a few types of wasp killers in the past.  Most project a stream of spray anywhere from 10 to 20 feet away from the nest.  I usually use Raid or Spectracide.  I don&amp;#8217;t think any of the sprays reach their claimed distance.  Spectracide claims 22 feet.  The best I ever achieved was about 15 feet.  I am sure it varies in their controlled tests and from can to can, climate, etc.  For my use, which is typically near my deck or house or in my yard, 15 feet is plenty.This brand, Terro, claims to be able to be applied from 20 feet away.  I have used it at about 6-8 feet, and as much as 15 feet.  Beyond that I don&amp;#8217;t think it reaches, and loses accuracy (hits a wider area than the intended target).It appears to be just as effective as the other brands.  I do think this is a better &amp;#8220;day time&amp;#8221; spray.  Most sprays tell you to use it in early evening, after wasps have returned to the nest.  Sometimes there are a lot of wasps about and you want to use your deck or areas right outside your home though, so you may find the need to use a spray in the daytime.  This spray forms a foam over its target, so it traps wasps, while also killing those who try to escape.As far as effectiveness on contact, I have found that Raid will usually result in an immediate kill, with many wasps falling out of the air as the spray touches them.  With Terro, it seems a few who made it through the foam died soon after, but maybe hung on for a few seconds, more so than with Raid or Spectracide.While the encapsulating foam is a great way to instantly &amp;#8220;lock down&amp;#8221; the nest and destroy its inhabitants, like any other spray, it does leave you with some clean up afterward.  Nothing that you can&amp;#8217;t hose away afterward.  Depending on how heavy you apply it (it doesn&amp;#8217;t take much to kill the wasps), you have a white foamy clump for 5 to 15 minutes.Terro says this product may be used indoors.  I would avoid using any spray of this type indoors.I have used it on my deck (pressure-treated wood) and against my house, near mortar and my vinyl siding (a tan &amp;#8220;Cedar Impressions&amp;#8221; shake style vinyl).  It doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to stain.  It leaves some residue until it is hosed away.I would recommend this product.  I don&amp;#8217;t know that it performs any better or worse than others, but again, if you plan to use it during the day when there is a lot of activity around the nest, you may prefer this over other brands.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;TERRO-rizes Pesky Wasps!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1405296000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 14, 2014&quot;}</td>

Assembly took me less than five minutes to put together came with 3 bolts and one wrench. The packaging was very well put together, as well. The instructions were very simple and easy to follow, which only took three steps, attached the three legs to the bowl with the sturdy bolts. The legs attach very easily and feel very stout.  The legs of the fire pit hold up the bowl. The log grate isn&amp;#8217;t built in like many other fire pits, instead it sits in the middle of the bowl. This makes it easier to remove and clean. The log grate is extremely important; its function is to improve the airflow. The bowl is a bit shallow, but is able to handle 3-4 logs without trouble.The stainless steel legs are a really nice touch; it gives the fit pit a modernized look. The bowl is very big and roomy; I didn&amp;#8217;t think so at fist when I saw the image. When the top cover is on it stands up to an adults thighs. The cover makes it really safe so children do not get to close to the fire. An ideal location for this pit would be in the lawn or patio area, it really catches the eye and entertains guests. The pit is very durable and can be used for many years as long as it&amp;#8217;s well kept. It did come with a cover, which I felt was not good in quality, but as long as it keeps the rain out I&amp;#8217;m happy. The pit itself is very light weight 30 pounds, which makes it easy to travel with and move around. I don&amp;#8217;t see why a person could not take this on a camping/out door trip, the legs attach and detach quite easy. It would have been nice if it came with a grate for grilling, because there is enough space between the log grate and the top of the pit.Overall all I am pleased about the value of this fire pit and its functionality. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable fire pit. I can&amp;#8217;t wait for a cool summer night to light up a fire and roast some marshmallows.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Sturdy Fire Pit&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1405814400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 20, 2014&quot;}</td>

I don&#39;t purchase junk, or spend as little as I can, however every gas powered anything consistently breaks on me in a short period of time. This is the reason I decided to go towards the electric side of things. Last year I bought a battery-reliant weed eater, and was nothing but exceptionally happy with that, so I decided to do the same with the snow blower. I was very concerned about poor power from the machine, however let me be one of the many people to tell you - you&#39;re going to have no issue with this thing!I live in NW Ohio, and we&#39;ve been absolutely demolished with snow this year. We&#39;ve set the record for the most snow in a given season (and that&#39;s even including the blizzard year of &#39;78!). I didn&#39;t pull the trigger and get this sooner, and wish I had - my (and my boyfriends) back would have really benefitted if we had. While I wasn&#39;t able to truly test this on the big snow dumps we had, we just had a nice 4-5&amp;#34; snow last night, and this thing performed miraculously well. I put it through its paces and pushed some of the older (and much more dense/ice-like) snow back, and this worked VERY well. As with all devices when you push it, it&#39;s going to complain a bit, however it did not pop any breakers like I&#39;ve seen people complain about other devices, and while it bogged down a slight bit, I was pushing it to the rated limits. I haven&#39;t taken stars off for this, because my neighbors little gas powered beast does the EXACT same thing, so I see this as not being an issue - if  you want better power, spend more and get a higher powered device!The reason I pulled back one star is while I really like the size, power, etc., I&#39;m slightly disappointed in the build quality - the chute that directs the snow comes in two pieces and is held together with a VERY small bolt, washer, and nut. I am happy this comes with a 4-year warranty, though, but really would have liked to see this built with a bit more heft so I wouldn&#39;t be concerned about it possibly breaking in the future during use.Bottom line: REALLY good power, slightly cheaply made, but ran really nicely and throws snow further than some gas powered equivalents!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great power, slightly concerned about possibly cheap design.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391904000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

You only have to put together the ring (attach legs) that holds the bowl which, even for my non-handy self, took less than 30 minutes. Once together the unit feels stable, sturdy and fairly safe (though all of these small fire bowls are hazardous if used improperly), and looks good, too.You aren&#39;t going to be putting large logs in this fire pit, and the included cover is extremely flimsy (ripped on our second use), but this is an otherwise good-looking, solid fire bowl, perfect for roasting marshmallows or just backyard ambiance. The beautiful cooper bowl did immediately discolor with use, but that&#39;s to be expected, though it does kind of diminish its appeal.I like that there is also a screen to put over the top to protect little ones, and lawns and homes, from sparks. Once it&#39;s on though you can&#39;t remove it, for instance, for additional marshmallow roasting, because the metal handle will quickly get untouchably hot (duh!), so only put it on AFTER you&#39;re done using the open flame. (And even then we used fire tongs to do so.) You could, kind of, roast on the heat coming through the grate, but we lost two marshmallows on it that way and it was pretty messy (melted marshmallow remains today), so I wouldn&#39;t recommend.Of course, be sure you&#39;re using the pit on a stable, fireproof surface (concrete or stone recommended) as putting this on your lawn is just asking for trouble ... In the form of a tipping bowl of fire onto a flammable surface. Not a good plan. Also, make sure all fires are fully extinguished and be aware that fire bowls are usually NOT exempt from burn bans, so please check and make sure they&#39;re allowed and safe in your are before using this or any other outdoor fireplace item. In short: be smart, be safe and if in doubt, don&#39;t set anything, including yourself, on fire, OK? :)Currently, it&#39;s pretty pricey for what you get, and the bowl discoloration and worthless cover almost made me rate this three stars, rather than four, but in the end we enjoyed it enough and it felt well-built so I went with four, but it was a close call.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Easy to Assemble, Feels Sturdy But Some Weaknesses&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400630400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 21, 2014&quot;}</td>

It was already together except for the chain that it hangs from and that took less than a minute to latch on to the sides. It latches on very strong so it hangs safely and evenly.

I am no longer able to carry five 50 pound feed bags at one time...(Well, I actually never could do that but that is what I tell my youngest grandsons when they were young and still a bit gullible.  For the past 40 years I have had trouble with just one).Anyway...When I first found this cart at a local Wal-Mart I was not a true believer.  I bought the thing anyway and I must tell you that it was money well spent.  It is difficult to believe that such a simply and at first glance, rather flimsy looking contraption can and does work so well.  I was shocked. It is extremely durable!  I use this thing for everything from hauling in grocers from the car to gardening and yard chores and building projects.  And let me tell you about rocks - good grief - along with the lifting restrictions I find that I can no longer throw larger stones out of my yard and garden into the neighbor&#39;s woods like I use to be able to.  But with this contraption I can now simply haul the things with little to no effort.I feel confident that this cart will be good up to at least 50 pounds of weight although I never fill it that full.  It is completely waterproof and leak proof.  It is extremely well made and I have not had any parts fall off as I work which is really an amazing thing these days.Now as others have pointed out, when you pull or push this thing without any weight in it, it tends to tip a little when going over rough ground.  For me this is really not a factor as I do not move all that fast any more but I have heard a couple of my grandsons whine about it from time to time.  (I wish I could still move that fast!).If you check Wal-Mart or some of your big outdoor supply stores you will find that you can purchase this cart for less than they are offering it here.  I paid about $12.00 less here locally and did not have to fret about the shipping.  This of course all depends upon your individual situation I suppose.Nice cart and I plan to get another this summer.

Regular small-grain birdfeed will be too small and just pour through the holes.Secondly, as the birds eat, lots of little bits of the feed (sunflower seed shells in my case) will fall down, so try to hang this above an area where you don&#39;t mind the mess. (I first had it on our patio, then moved it so it hangs above an area where plants and flowers grow so the little bits of food just hit the soil instead of junk up the patio).As long as you&#39;re aware of these two facts, this bird feeder should work well for you.

These mats are not suitable for conventional outdoor grilling, where high heat and licks of flame are part of the process. These mats are suitable to use in place of parchment paper on your cookie sheets.I grill because I want to create nice crusty sear marks on my foods, whether it be steaks, burgers, kabobs, veggies, seafood or fish. Even when I need to cook foods at a lower-than-high temperature, I still start out by searing the outside. Why bother grilling if that is not the result you are looking for?When I grill over fire (wood or charcoal), even when I try to prevent flare-ups, they happen. And when I crank up the Weber gas grill, it heats to well-over 500 degrees before I toss on the food. Same with my Char Broil infrared grill.The mats are basically like a Silpat mat.Mats are NOT suitable for live fire grilling: Why? Because you can NOT allow flame to touch them.Mats are NOT suitable for searing: Why? Because you can NOT allow temperature to go over 500 degrees Fahrenheit.With these mats, you will definitely prevent your grill grates from getting messy, but you will never be able to create a Maillard Effect (caramelization), because you will never be able to get the mats hot enough to create a sear. And, if you&#39;ve used a marinade, and if your food becomes juicy, the liquid will run off the mat because there is no lip....Hmmmm.....So you will still get flare-ups and you will still get your grates messy.ABOUT THE SKEWERS: They, also, are limited in use: The tips are rounded, not pointy and sharp for easy piercing. These rounded tips mangle delicate seafood and veggies. Forget trying to skewer tomatoes, onion rings, peppers or shrimp. Take a close look at the middle picture, you can see how rounded the tips are. Also, notice that the tips are a bigger diameter than the rest of the skewer. What that means is this: You thread the food over the tips and create a big hole. Then you slide it onto the very pliable thinner cable. Your food will definitely NOT hold in place. It swings around and flops around on the narrow cable, because it started out by going through a big hole.And I&#39;m not sure how this replaces aluminum foil or how it can be used effectively for roasting: Foil wraps any way you want it to, and it can keep fluids contained so you don&#39;t lose the juices and so you don&#39;t dirty a pan. These mats are flat and will always be flat and fluid will run right off of it.All around this is a very bad idea for the grill.*I received a sample product from TeiKis for review, and I&#39;m not a wimp and not afraid to hand out one-star reviews when they are warranted. If I had paid money for this crap, I would be livid right now. I don&#39;t regret spending the time writing a review on it--my ultimate goal is to help customers think through their decisions to buy, before they hit the buy-button, and before things get ugly when they open a package and are disappointed by what they find inside.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;WARNING: Suitable for non-seared, lower heat situations only&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401408000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

The main problems with hummingbird feeders is they can leak, they fill up with ants and the wasps take over and keep the birds away. This feeder after being up for a week does not leak. They have addressed the other issues, but it will be awhile in Wisconsin before these other issues are tested. The area where the bird gets the juice has a raised end point to keep the wasps from getting the juice. The top of the feeder has a reservoir which can be filled with water to keep the ants from crossing over to the feeder from the hanger. I have not yet been able to test these, but they do seem like good ideas.One problem that I can foresee is that the water will evaporate quickly and will require attention. The container for the provided nectar fills the feeder about half way. Generally we just use sugar and water which is boiled to purify. This takes time and a  premix would be nice, though the one that comes with the unit does have food coloring in it which I see as unnecessary. The perches on the feeder are very flimsy but then...hummingbirds don&#39;t weigh much.  Overall you likely cannot go wrong with this feeder. If the pest &amp;#34;fixes&amp;#34; don&#39;t work, you have a good feeder which will be just like all other feeders anyway.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;hummingbird feeder&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399507200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

Skip this and look at a chipper instead. This needs dry leaves slowly fed into it for it to shred them properly. It can not handle any wet leaves (and when are leaves totally dry?) nor can it handle sticks/branches of any kind.If you are looking at reducing the amount of yard waste you place at the curb, you might instead consider a vacuum/blower that shreds leaves as it goes. The power of suction will normally create a better end result and they can handle items other than dry leaves slightly better.Now if you have a composting bin/box and are looking for something to allow you to shred leaves finely for that and can take the time to sort your leaves to select dry ones without sticks, then this device will work for you. But honestly you are the exception and I am guessing that most people think they can dump leaves randomly into this and not overload it...that just isn&#39;t the case.If this had metal teeth that could handle sticks and was designed to limit the intake better so it could handle dumping large amounts in, then it would be a 5 star product--even at the higher price required.

But they insist on stealing all the other critters&#39; food, even though the squirrels have more than enough for their fat little selves already.One has to wonder if they didn&#39;t have an insider on the design team for this very poorly designed bird feeder, because it&#39;s really a squirrel feeder. The top has no threads or snap-on feature to lock it down, so the squirrels just climb on top of the feeder and have their way with it. Plus the cheap plastic window is out of keeping with the otherwise solid steel construction. And most birds don&#39;t seem to want to use it, as almost all of them prefer the old school wood feeder we have a dozen feet away. The perches on this are small and round, hardly comfy for most of our flighty friends.Still, all they have to do is put some threads or a snap on top. And use some decent plastic for the windows! This stuff is like the plastic on top of folder files. This would only be worth its 28 buck price tag if those two things were rectified.Until then, this feeder is for the squirrels, not the birds.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Very nice squirrel feeder!

E. Nelson&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [1, 3], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;I was hoping to get a few car washes in with this hose in the time that I owned it, but Mother Nature did not cooperate.  The two warm spring days in the Chicagoland area we have had thus far were spent teaching one of the kids to ride their bike and not cleaning cars.  Regardless, I rolled out the hose on a rather chilly spring day and gave it a shot.The temperature when I used the hose was 48F.  Why am I mentioning this?  The directions on the hose recommend setting the hose up when it is above 70F.  Despite being well below the recommended temperature, the hose did indeed lay flat on the ground as advertised.  Despite being left out overnight in around freezing temperatures and being only around 50F when I used it, the hose remained soft and pliable in the cool weather, even after running cold water through it.  It remained easy to coil up by hand while my other &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; hose was stiff and would only easily make large loops when I tried to coil it up by hand.Walking around the yard, I personally did not experience any kinks in the hose nor did I see any portion of the hose threatening to kink if I pulled it tight.  It remained fairly flat to the ground and did not bunch up.I thought the connectors to the hose were excellent.  Prior to obtaining this hose, I had no idea that the quality of hose connectors varied.  The female end of the hose is large and textured.  This makes it easy to grab and the design of the connector makes it incredibly easy to thread the fitting on the spigot.  I did not have to fight with the fitting to get it threaded on the spigot like I did with my other hoses.  The male end is just as easy.  The hose attachment threads right onto the hose fitting.The only drawback I had with this hose was the female fitting.  I ensured the washer was in place and that it was seated into the female fitting, but the connection still leaked.  I tried it on several different spigots and attaching it to the male end of another hose but the hose still leaked at the female fitting.  In all due fairness this hose leaked a lot less than my other hoses when I tried those.  Perhaps this is being caused by the cold shrinking the rubber washer.  For now, I am deducting a star for that reason.  If it works better when it gets above 70F, I will adjust my rating accordingly.If someone had told me that it was a worthwhile investment to spend around $1 per foot on a garden hose, I would have thought they were out of their mind.  I would have said that my 100 foot hose I got from a warehouse store for $30 works just fine.  However, after trying a quality hose like this one, I will be replacing my cheap hoses as soon as funds allow.  I highly recommend this hose!  Fighting with stiff hoses that bunch up and kink every time tension is put on them will be a thing of the past!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I Will Never Buy A Cheap Hose Again!!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397606400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

I took it out of the box, and went outside to stir my compost pile.  Two days ago, I had removed the sticks, which had mixed into the vines, leaves and such that were in the pile. This left me with about a foot of well degraded plant material, mixed with dirt, and random fine roots.  I started to jab the pointed  end into the pile. However, the wings which are suppose to fold down and then stir the pile, simply stayed up. I would pull them down manually, and when it was placed back into the pile, they&#39;d immediately fold back up. &amp;#34;At least the bottom tip is mixing up the mulch&amp;#34; I thought to myself.  After about 15-20 minutes, I looked at the tip, which was bent to the side about 45 degrees. The cheap paint on the steel (?) had flaked off the tip too.Usually garden tools last a lifetime. In fact, I have garden tools I inherited from uncles long dead, so they are lasting TWO lifetimes.  Nevertheless I can accept if a garden tool only lasts a few decades.  Or at least lasts a few years.  But when you get a tool, and it only lasts a FEW MINUTES?  Perhaps the company changed the materials that they make the aerator from, or they changed the company that they subcontracted to mold the metal tip. If you look at other recent reviews, others have also encountered the tip bending over, or the wings that bend down so you can stir, not bending down.  I hope the company fixes this problem, because this seems to be a good tool for mixing the compost pile.  Unless you have a shovel.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Tip bent after 20 minutes of use&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398211200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 23, 2014&quot;}</td>

Could have been the super long and miserable winter, but I could not WAIT to get this set up. Luckily, setup was a breeze and required no tools whatsoever. Screw about six things in by hand, loop the hammock over the hooks and you&#39;re in business. In less than ten minutes, I was enjoying my first hammock ever!Some others mentioned an odor/smell, but I didn&#39;t notice anything. I set this up outdoors in about 70 degree weather and didn&#39;t notice anything and I&#39;m highly sensitive to smells, esp that new plastic/manufacturing smell.I didn&#39;t have any struggles putting the pieces together, either. It was so easy to put together and I truly did appreciate not having to use any tools to screw anything into place.I logged about two hours in the &#39;mock today and I have to tell you, there&#39;s no uncomfortable position. I initially was a little skeptical that I&#39;d like a hammock that was so wide (seeing the hammock &#39;burrito&#39; pictures some others posted left me curious), but I&#39;ve found that the wideness can sometimes provide some shade, too. There are so many ways to lie on this and it&#39;s just so cozy. I opted for the cotton hammock (color: tropical), and not the sunbrella fabric. The cotton is super soft and durable.I will take the cotton hammock part in the garage when not in use, but will leave the stand in the yard all summer.The hammock and stand seem very well-made. I had no hesitation about moving around in it and getting in and out. This hammock can accommodate up to 450 lbs. I had my boyfriend join me in the hammock, but it was kind-of cramped and, as he said, \&quot;it&#39;s not my thing\&quot;. Pffft - more hammock for me!The hammock and stand come with a carrying case, too. I don&#39;t imagine I&#39;ll be transporting my hammock any where, but it does indeed break down easily and fits in a very nice little bag if you want to hammock somewhere else. Nice addition.So far, I&#39;m very impressed! I&#39;ll update this review at the end of the season and note any flaws or issues, if applicable. For $130 (as of this writing), I&#39;m very happy and look forward to wasting away the summer in this!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Is it too early to be OBSESSED with this hammock?

But I have also become increasingly disabled so have been trying some more compact grills. I ordered this since like so many have stated, it LOOKS very APPLE like.Looks verses performance....Being so disabled I had 2 neighbors assemble it for me and as a reward, be the first to cook on it with MY food. The box is in itself like a little puzzle you follow to assemble the grill. It&#39;s really funny watching neighbors argue about assembly when drinking a few beers with such an odd cut along the dotted lines layout:-)It took maybe 30 minutes of actual assembly time using MY tools. Add another 15 minutes for USMC opinion sharing that wasn&#39;t needed but free entertainment for me anyway. On a side note, I wish Vendors would allow me to choose WHO delivers my parcels....Especially given what my driver has told me about the FUN they have seeing who can toss what the HARDEST off of walls etc......Given the ripped, torn, slashed parcels I have received from UPS I have NO respect for them and would elect to even pay a premium for FEDEX or USPS. Luckily, the contents here were &amp;#8220;OK&amp;#8221; and all worked fine.We had very quick and EVEN cooking/heat. We only elected to cook 6 hamburgers since Marines I know anyway are happy as can be with just good old beer &amp; burgers. Meat was juicy as any other grill I have owned as long as I do NOT flip them constantly. I cook 4 minute on Medium, flip for another 3-4 minutes and EAT the suckers.I LOVE the look and functional design. I am still getting used to using the lid design but I am so disabled I have odd problems with even the most simple things. I like the locking wheels though I can&#39;t imagine my wheelchair going fast enough with a lap full food to add to the grill that I could really have much NEED for them?To be honest, it is simply the BEAUTY of this that attracts me to it so much. I give it 4 stars and if nothing fails or no weak links appear, I will raise it to 5 stars. I will also have to buy another LPG cylinder if I keep using this over my other since I am unable to swap out my single tank between my grills and this does NOT come with one of it&#39;s own....No big deal, just be aware you do NOT get one included.. The one negative for me and it is sort of a BIG one since I am so disabled is this has no fold up/down side trays of any type. This is one of those things where it is simply built to show off it&#39;s looks and for me anyway, a very much needed item is left out to help keep it beautiful. Still, I NEED that so have to use a patio table next to it for this purpose instead.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;BEAUTIFUL To Look At, Nice To Cook With&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398297600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 24, 2014&quot;}</td>

I put the chimney on top of the grate, but you can also put it directly on top of the coals and then ignite the paper. Just make sure that there is a way for air to circulate underneath the chimney in order to create the necessary flow of air (draft) to ignite the coals.If you buy a chimney starter, regardless of size, here&#39;s a tip on how to make sure you get hot coals in the shortest time. Roll the paper into a donut shape and then put it in the bottom. That will insure that there is sufficient air and draft at the very beginning of the process to light the coals.Let&#39;s eat!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Perfect size for my purpose&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394409600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 10, 2014&quot;}</td>

It offers decent homeowner-grade performance with the benefit of being attachment capable. Not heavy-duty enough for extensive use, and the bump head is very finicky.Full review: It&amp;#8217;s getting tough to find something that isn&#39;t made by MTD these days. That&amp;#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing since they make some decent gear considering the price. (They also make some really poor stuff as well.)This is one of their decent efforts. The main issue with the Remington, much like everything made by MTD, is that it&amp;#8217;s intended for light-duty use. It&amp;#8217;s perfectly fine for they typical suburban yard, but if you have a couple of acres to deal with, need something for commercial use, or want something that will last for a couple of decades, look elsewhere (I&amp;#8217;d suggest brands such as Stihl or Echo. A lot more money, but a lot more durable as well).Starting/running &amp;#8211; fired up pretty quickly right out of the box. It comes with oil and uses a 40:1 ratio (again, typical of most MTD devices). I did have to adjust the idle so it would run smoothly at low RPMs, which is easy to do (outlined clearly in the manual). It has a spring loaded pull rope which I really like. I have that on my Troy-Bilt machines, and it&amp;#8217;s a great feature for folks like me with back problems. Rather than have to do a sharp tug to get it started, you pull the rope in a smooth motion. There&amp;#8217;s a spring that compresses when you pull, and then releases. It&amp;#8217;s hard to explain but easy to use and a great feature for ease of starting. The downside is that when the spring breaks, it&amp;#8217;s a major, major pain to fix.Power &amp;#8211; This has a decent amount of power (25cc 2-cycle engine) for getting through tough weeds, provided you use good quality line. Although this is attachment-capable, it does not have enough power to effectively run things such as a tiller attachment. It&amp;#8217;s fine for most other attachments.Attachments &amp;#8211; This has the typical split boom setup and will take attachments made by MTD (and their related brands such as Craftsman). I tried it with attachments from Troy-Bilt and Craftsman (an edger and a straight shaft trimmer head) without any problems.Weight/Balance &amp;#8211; Decent on both. The vibration was not too bad &amp;#8211; on a par with others in this price range. The grip handle is hard plastic but reasonably comfortable.Controls &amp;#8211; straightforward. The build quality on some, such as the choke lever, is not great, so some care is needed to ensure it does not break. I like that the on/off switch is on the shaft near the handle so it&amp;#8217;s easy to get to.Bump head &amp;#8211; horrible! I didn&#39;t have much faith that it would work well since every other MTD bump head I&#39;ve tried has been poor. This was no exception &amp;#8211; feeding is sporadic and the force needed to feed out line puts way too much stress on the drive shaft (e.g., you&amp;#8217;ll end up cracking it when bumping the line). If you get this, toss the bump head and get a fixed line head. You can pick one up at a home center store for just a few bucks. Yes, you&amp;#8217;ll need to manually put the line in, but it&amp;#8217;s very simple and far more reliable than the bump feed. Plus, you can use better quality line, such as Gatorline, which cuts through weeds much better than the standard stuff.Tip: MTD machines hate ethanol in gas &amp;#8211; it will kill the fuel lines. I add both Sta-Bil and Sea Foam to my gas, and that has worked great. Zero problems with fuel lines, and all my 2-cycle machines have started and run well over the years.This is a decent choice for light-duty use. It&amp;#8217;s not one of those tools that you&amp;#8217;ll be able to hand down to the grand kids, but it will get the job done for several years (provided that you maintain it and use additives in the gas). The split shaft allows you to use this for multiple jobs, such as edging, or replace the curved shaft with a straight shaft. In comparison to a Stihl or Echo it&amp;#8217;s quite poor, but, for the price charged, it&amp;#8217;s a pretty decent choice. 5 stars since it delivers a good level of performance for the price.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A decent value in an MTD-brand trimmer&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395792000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

I believe we may have gotten bad coir, I will not be buying this again.I decided to reseed some seeds into the leftover coir, the plants are not doing too well either. I transplanted some of the good plants into regular soil while I could. But while transplanting all the coir was breaking away from the roots exposing the roots to nothing but air. This stuff is horrible to work with. There must be something wrong with it for 3 people to have all their plants die from this coir.Save yourself some time and just get regular organic soil.

As the plants grow you can raise the light up by the pull of a string.The only thing i would change about this light that would make it better would be if it had 2 bulbs so it covers more area.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;overall&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">5.0</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;summary&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>grow light<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;unixReviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">1393718400</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;reviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>03 2, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

I even spied one of the culprits, a little thing not much bigger than a sparrow.

Set it, release it, etc so it is second nature.  Even think about putting a cover over it such as an old sheet or pillowcase cut down and cut out around handle and on the cage on the top and both sides - not the ends, when it is baited, so when you walk up and you have caught a tiny something, you won&#39;t scare it to death before you get it relocated.  Also helps in case whatever you have inside the trap decides to spray...okay this won&#39;t work in the case of skunks :)  You are on your own there........This Havahart 1061 worked great to relocate a family of desert ground squirrels who were in the way of some construction and certain death!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Wanted it primarily for desert ground squirrels!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401148800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 27, 2014&quot;}</td>

While the lid closes, it would be easy for a squirrel to pick up and eat the seed from the top. So far, the squirrels haven&#39;t done this. The post is not easy to climb, and it&#39;s not under a tree where they could drop down on the cover.There is a metal band around the plastic seed holder at the top, presumably to keep squirrels from biting the seed container. However, the seed tray is plastic and could easily be chewed on by squirrels.I&#39;m not dissatisfied with this bird feeder.

What works for the particular moles in my yard, may be more or less effective with those found in your particular area.  Anytime you&#39;re trying to repel wildlife (at least with a modicum of responsibility and safety), you&#39;re going to have to resign yourself to imprecise results.With that out of the way, Tomcat 34784 appears to have done the job for me.  You have to apply it over a 3 or 4 day period, basically herding (if that word can be used) the moles off to somewhere else, i.e. not your yard.  I&#39;ve tried both the liquid and the granular, with no visible difference in effectiveness.

You can buy one separately or just use an existing table, or even just place it on concrete if you don&#39;t mind bending down to cook, like an old hibachi. The unit uses those little propane cans that are cheapest to purchase at places such as Flowes or Home Desposts. Avoid getting them at supermarkets where the markup can be 3-5x as much for desperate shoppers.There&#39;s plenty of heat for cooking frozen chicken, which is usually the toughest thing to cook properly on a portable grill.  However, what I enjoy most is the through the purchase of the griddle unit.  You have to buy it separately but with that, you can easily cook bacon, sausages, eggs, and anything else for breakfast.  I really enjoy this because breakfast is my preferred meal of the day, and the outdoors doesn&#39;t get too hot in the early morning.No cons with this unit, except it&#39;s so well regarded that it becomes a theft magnet so make sure to cover it up out of sight because even thieves know how great this unit is !&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Q1000 is the gold standard for portable propane grilling&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393027200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 22, 2014&quot;}</td>

I tried Repellex brand ready-to-spray last year because I read some good reviews and it also has other ingredients besides castor oil.  To my surprise, it seemed to work!Well now comes major hitter Ortho--so I had to try it.  Sprays easily using hose end.  I sprayed mainly my flower beds and also select parts of the lawn.  Now will have to see if they come back.  This is using it as a preventative.  I previously used the Repellex when I had an infestation and within two days, there was no new mole activity.  I have saved half the bottle of Ortho for when I do have an infestation--and trust me, they are almost always back every year.  If I don&#39;t trap them, they will stick around in my flower beds and tear up my lawn.  I recommend trapline traps.Will update later with my observations.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Another mole repellant&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396915200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

The main reason I purchased this particular pruning saw was that it uses Black and Decker&#39;s interchangeable 20 Volt lithium batteries I&#39;ve standardized upon recently.  I am almost to my goal of being becoming 100% standardized on Black &amp; Decker&#39;s 20 volt lithium battery powered tools.I strongly recommend Black and Decker&#39;s series of tools that use 20 volt lithium battery.  But be aware that there are three different 20 volt batteries. One to avoid if possible is the 22 Watt Hour battery.  Get the 30 Watt Hour battery that is almost the same price.  And there is the double sized Black &amp; Decker LB2X4020-OPE battery for about 50% higher price.  But there is an advantage of having multiple 30 Watt Hour batteries.  You can be charging one while using another battery.

It is recommended to keep a layer of sand along the base of the pit to help evenly distribute the heat and to stop areas from burning out too quickly.This kit also comes with a guard removal tool, a long hook that allows you to hook the handle and remove the guard without risk of burning. Also included is a vinyl cover which I thought was a great addition. However the cover seems to a bit too small for the pit and it is quite a tight squeeze--try too hard and it will rip.

Reader&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [1, 1], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;The best way for me to evaluate this trap is to compare it against the venerable wooden Victor type trap . . . the one that&#39;s been around forever, and I have used and am quite familiar with.The traditional wooden trap WORKS, but has two drawbacks:1.  Very touchy to set and then put in place.  Jarring or improper setting of the trip bar can result in an unexpected trip (and possibly broken fingers).  This Tomcat Rat Snap Trap is super easy and safe to set.  Use hand or foot to depress the set pedal down until it clicks.  Bait is inserted via the bottom using the removable bait cup.  You never have to put your digits in the kill zone.2. With the old-fashioned wooden type trap, there is the possibility of the rat approaching the bait from the reverse side of the trap.  This can cause the rat to be tossed clear and result in a \&quot;non-catch\&quot;.  You can bet the sly rodent will now be trap-shy.  With the Tomcat, the rat can only approach from the \&quot;business-end\&quot; of the trap (front or sides), resulting in a reliable catch/kill.  In the case of a capture but non-kill, the Tomcat&#39;s interlocking teeth are more effective that the old smooth metal bar at preventing withdrawal and escape.A well thought-out and effective trap.  More expensive than the traditional wooden ones, but the cost is justified, I think, by the superior design and performance of this Motomco Tomcat Rat Snap Trap.  Can be used over and over for years.  I really like it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great design:  Easy to set.

The metal was welded on well enough there was no danger of deformation or detachment when I did so. A little paint did chip off, however. Because of this perpendicular piece of metal, you can only drive it down about 6\&quot;. If your soil is a bit looser on top, it&#39;s not deep enough to keep the stake from wobbling a bit, but enough to keep it in place.The connection threads are really short - less than half an inch for both sides. I would have liked it to be a little longer since I just feel as if there&#39;s a better, more secure connection that way. If you leave the included washer in on the incoming connection, the length to connect shortens to about 1/4 inch. I used teflon tape where I could, and have had no issues with leaking around the connections.The faucet points more horizontal than vertical so if you add connections (I attached a 4-way manifold), it juts out, I would estimate, about 70 degrees from the stake. Besides being unsightly, the water shoots out from my manifold mostly horizontally instead of down. It makes it difficult if you&#39;re just trying to drop water down from the faucet into a bucket or watering can. With a little testing, you can learn to open the faucet just enough with a low enough flow the water will flow mostly down, hold the bucket up next to the faucet, or just figure out where to place your bucket on the ground wherever the water ends up falling. More guesswork than I would like to bother with.This bib extender works for the basic need of placing a faucet in another location.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Basic needs&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400976000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 25, 2014&quot;}</td>

Granted, it helps novice gardeners from making mistakes such as using a high nitrogen fertilizer on something such as tomatoes, but it also is somewhat unnecessary provided you read the formulation.This is a 10-7-7 fertilizer. The first number refers to nitrogen (helps with greening and foliage growth); the second is for phosphorus (promotes root growth); the third is for potassium (helps strengthen plant cells). It&amp;#8217;s a good formulation for pansies but also can be used for other flowering plants.It also includes small amounts of sulfur (improves uptake of nutrients), iron (aids in plant health and improves the green color) and manganese (helps with iron absorption). All in all, a generally decent fertilizer formulation.The granules are small but not too powdery, and are uniform in size. It&amp;#8217;s easy to spread and work into the soil. Watering after application is recommended and, given the high N content, you should take care not to get this on foliage (or wash it off if you do) to prevent burning.The cons are the cost &amp;#8211; this is very pricey per pound, and there&amp;#8217;s nothing special about the formulation to justify the cost. The other con is that only one-third of the nitrogen is from water insoluble sources (which for this fertilizer is feather meal, bone meal and meat meal). Water insoluble sources are important to prevent fertilizer run-off into streams and other water bodies, where it promotes algae blooms. While water soluble nitrogen works faster and gives you that quick &amp;#8220;pop&amp;#8221; of growth and color, it is not ideal due to run off.I&amp;#8217;ll give this 3 stars. While it has merits, the cons balance it out to an average score.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Decent fertilizer but pricey and low in organic nitrogen&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398556800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 27, 2014&quot;}</td>

Unlike the other pair that I have, these are actually comfortable to use! Rather than use an elastic band to hold the grabber to your hand, the handle is designed so that your hand fits in and can grasp the grabber without the need for any elastic straps. Not only did I find that more comfortable to use, it also made it more efficient &amp;#8211; I could control grasping things easier and could get them off my hands without any problem.The build quality is pretty decent. It&amp;#8217;s all plastic, as expected, but the plastic seems thick enough to stand up to quite a bit of use. I like that the front edge is solid, rather than have &amp;#8220;teeth&amp;#8221; like my other grabbers. I had a much easier time scooping things up with these since there were no gaps for things (mostly twigs and the like) to fall through.They measure 15 inches at the widest point and are about 15 inches long (end to end). The scoop depth is excellent &amp;#8211; it was hard to measure, but I&amp;#8217;d estimate it at about 5 inches deep, which is more than deep enough to hold a lot of whatever it is you&amp;#8217;re picking up. There&amp;#8217;s a slot at the hand end so you can hang them up on a nail in the garage. They also come with a storage bag, which is a nice touch.Zero complaints about these &amp;#8211; it made quick work of picking up a big swath of mulch and debris that got washed out of my planing beds due to a massive rainstorm.In addition to using two of them to grab up leaves and debris, using just one is a great way to speed up smoothing out planting beds or mulch. I love multi functional tools!Great design, solid build quality, and excellent performance. Far better in both comfort and performance than the ones with elastic bands and teeth on the end.

It trims quick and fast, much more power than I was expecting from an electric and more powerful than others I&#39;ve used.  I didn&#39;t have any problems with the auto-advance, though maybe my technique (and yard) involved more starting and stopping, thus letting advance work. I loved the edger adjustment, couldn&#39;t be easier to shift modes and that saves time and allows me to focus on specific areas completely.For me and my purposes, this works great.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;powerful and relatively easy to use&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399852800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 12, 2014&quot;}</td>

It&#39;s easy to use but holds only a small amount of seed and with the winter we&#39;ve had this year, frequent refilling was not something I wanted to deal with (nor is it ever, really).  I&#39;m still dreaming of the squirrel repellent, too.  Hanging it does ameliorate the cat problem, though.I think this might be a fun feeder for someone just starting to feed birds.  Platform feeders do attract a lot of species, and in all fairness, it&#39;s not the squirrels&#39; favorite feeder.  It would also dispense safflower seed very well, which squirrels don&#39;t like (although it&#39;s really not #1 on the hit parade for most birds, either).  If I were gifting this to a new bird-feeding fan, I&#39;d include a bag of safflower for this feeder, a bag of black sunflower, and aBrome Squirrel Buster Plusfor the black sunflower.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Might be a nice starter feeder&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397347200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 13, 2014&quot;}</td>

I grilled 8 burgers and 6 bratwurst simultaneously using both zones. Assembly was quick and painless (&amp;#60; 30min) thanks to very well thought out packaging. It felt like opening an iPhone; there was nearly no wasted space and you only had to unpack parts as they were needed. My only qualm with the assembly was that the quick instructions didn&#39;t account for a couple of included parts. They were however referenced in the manual, although in the parts list one part was called the ignition stick but in the instructions it was referred to as the lighting stick (just kind of weird considering how much attention to detail everything else was given). One thing to note is that in order to get the grill to temperature you MUST have the cover on. Even with the cover on, cooking took a bit longer than I was used to.

I like how the rotary blade assemblies are modular and can be replaced one at a time, or simply removed one by one to allow for a different tilling pattern in your garden.  That&#39;s pretty cool.  I also like the twist-lock feature on the extendable handle, versus other tools that I have that screw to tighten.  At least for me, the handle was very easy to lock/unlock in position, and it didn&#39;t come loose when I was using it.While I do love the twist-lock on the handle, one downside is that you can only go between the two lengths of fully-retracted or fully-extended.  You can&#39;t customize the length anywhere in between.  The length worked for me, and I&#39;m 5&#39;9\&quot;.The reason for my rating this as just \&quot;OK\&quot; with three stars is that it didn&#39;t churn up my soil very well.  Yes, I put my back into it.  :)  I tried it on my lawn before reseeding, which was essentially compacted top soil, and also on a couple of other areas that have more loose dirt.  I wasn&#39;t too impressed by how much effort it took for so little turnover on the soil.  Now, that might just be because my soil is more compacted than most and that I really need a powered tiller, but unless you have looser soil - you might experience the same thing.So, I was impressed overall with the quality of the unit, but I didn&#39;t have much luck with results.  Because of that, I don&#39;t give it a recommendation unless you have looser soil that you just want to turn over.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Some slick design features, but not effective on tough ground&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402963200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 17, 2014&quot;}</td>

They are quality PWs that deliver depending upon your needs. For my needs, the best PW is the Karcher G 2650 gas-powered Honda engine pressure washer. This 2,000 psi electric pressure washer is, by comparison, almost a toy. But to be fair, it&#39;s a nice, light, easy to use little thing. If you just want to wash the car and spray some dirt from a small porch, it may be perfect for you. By contrast, my pressure washing needs are significant. I live with a lot of animals and a lot of hard, exterior surfaces and everything gets dusty or muddy by turns. A good, powerful pressure washer is essential unless I want to spend half a day hosing down sidewalks, patios, and driveway. My gas-powered Karcher gets the job done FAST. This little electric unit is hardly more powerful than my garden hose turned full force and equipped with a good pistol grip spray nozzle. And there are all those hoses to move thither and yon. Admittedly only one more hose than the gas-powered washer has, but for me with all the space I have to cover, it&#39;s the hose that broke this camel&#39;s back. To its credit, the Karcher 2,000 psi electric is easier to start, easier to lift, and more convenient to power. So, if your need is for a relative lightweight, it likely will do the job. But don&#39;t be misled, if you&#39;ve got a lot of ground (concrete, stone, etc.) to cover, you may need what I need, the Karcher 2,650 psi gas-powered model.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Karcher 2,650 psi gas PW or Karcher 2,000 psi electric PW?&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397260800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 12, 2014&quot;}</td>

Cox \&quot;Shanghaied\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [2, 3], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;I never imagined getting fertilizer from Amazon until now. I got this blended 10-0-6 fertilizer almost three weeks ago. It looked certain it would rain, so I put it down immediately.  I used the guide for my spreader and it only covered about 60% of my front yard.  I have a driveway that bifurcates my front yard in the same proportion, so it was easy to see the difference it would make. And it did rain as expected and about three more moderate rains since then.  In my haste, I forgot that I had already put down some 29-0-10 weed and feed fertilizer in some weed infested areas a couple of weeks prior to this fertilizer application.  To be honest, I haven&#39;t seen much of a visible effect after nearly three weeks except for the large spot where I used the weed and feed fertilizer. So it is very likely a cumulative effect of this 10-0-6 fertilizer and the 29-0-10 weed and feed fertilizer that led to the very green grass area.The first number is the amount of available nitrogen, the second number is phosphate and the third number is potash. High nitrogen makes for fast green growth, but not necessarily good plant health.  The potash ingredient is there for overall plant health. The clear majority of the weight is filler - usually about 70%. It is all designed to be highly water soluble to get into the soil - or be washed away into the street gutter and into the groundwater supply.Part of my test result was tainted by the prior high nitrogen weed and feed fertilizer application. But it does illustrate the short term effect of nitrogen for a fast growing green yard (but not necessarily a long term healthy yard). This was the first fertilizer application in well over a year, so my yard was probably nitrogen starved. And it is still very early in the growing season following an unusually cold winter to make an accurate assessment. I lost some St. Augustine grass from fungus last year and some from the winter hard freeze. So I needed some high nitrogen fertilizer initially to spur growth to cover the dead areas. But next I&#39;ll drop back to a milder fertilizer like this.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Works Well&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397865600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 19, 2014&quot;}</td>

It&#39;s been a few years since I&#39;d last fertilized my lawn because of the damage done to my lawn with burn spots.It took less than 2/3 of the bag to cover my 1/10 of an acre lawn using a spreader. The yellow color of the pellets made it easy to see just how well it spread and there weren&#39;t any clumps to break apart.I&#39;d waited until the grass had already turned green after the harsh winter before applying this, not wanting to confuse what nature would have done on its own with the effectiveness of the fertilizer. There were still some patches left where I thought the grass (and even my green weeds) were dead from last year.Well it&#39;s not going to suddenly give you this perfect lawn; that will require more effort on my part.  But the lawn is definitely a richer green and thicker than it had been and the brown patches are smaller and showing more signs of life.No burn spots from this application; a definite plus.Amended:  It&#39;s been about 3 weeks since the lawn was fertilized and I can only assume that this is why I&#39;ve suddenly got a yard full of dandelions after we&#39;d spent a lot of time and effort to eradicate them last year.  I&#39;m making that assumption because most of the rest of the neighborhood, including the next door neighbors, have very little of these weeds.  Perhaps it&#39;s best to do a weed and feed before applying the fertilizer.Amended:  It&#39;s been two months since the application and wow, my lawn has never looked or felt so good.  The lawn is incredibly thick and there are no brown spots left.  I&#39;m the original owner of this house and have been here for thirteen years.  It&#39;s not perfect.

We made 2 drilled out logs with perches and stuffed the holes with homemade suet and then also have bird feeders with trays for seed.This feeder says to fill it with sunflower seeds. The birds that are attracted to and enjoy sunflower seeds are cardinals, grosbeaks, chickadees and sparrows. Cardinals and grosbeaks will not feed off of this feeder unless they are desperate; they want tray feeders.When this is filled with sunflower seeds, the bottom holes are so large that you lose a great amount of the seeds dropping on the ground.The fly through holes can catch the birds and make it difficult for them to get out. I watched one fat chickadee struggle and hurt itself when several grackles approached. The last I saw of the poor chickadee was it hopping and dragging a wing across the snow on our deck. That was also the last time this feeder was used.Between the holes that drop the sunflower seeds and the damage to birds- this is not a feeder for the birds.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Not for the birds&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394496000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 11, 2014&quot;}</td>

I used these claws to shred the leftover chicken and I&#39;m amazed!  The claws fit really well in my hands, and the claws are sharp and strong enough to make quick work of shredding meat.  Since they pull off small bits and don&#39;t cut the meat, I was left with a pile of truly shredded chicken meat.  They hand washed easily, and are small enough to store stacked in a drawer when not in use.  I&#39;m also looking forward to using them to lift chickens and turkeys from the roasting pan, without burning myself or dropping the bird and splashing myself with the hot juices.And in the off-chance that some passing thief smells your BBQ and breaks in, you can go all Wolverine on them with these claws and save your shredded meat!

It also contains sulfur, but that is usually available in soil from decomposition of plants.  Almost all plants need nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (these they need the most and are often abbreviated NPK for the chemical symbols), calcium, magnesium, and sulfur (these they need smaller amounts of, I put Epsom salt on my lilacs because they like a lot of magnesium and sulfer).  Pansies need these minerals as well as iron and manganese (called micro nutrients, they only need a little).This fertilizer is 10-7-7 or 10% Nitrogen 7% phosphorus and 7% potassium.  This is actually on the low end for percentage of active ingredients and for flowering potted plans I usually choose 15-30-15.  Since the main reasons we like pansies is the flowers, I am surprised that the 10-7-7 ratio, usually you want to reduce the nitrogen (slowing the growth) so the extra energy is put into flowering.  But I am not an expert on pansies, so perhaps they grow differently.That said, this is really expensive for the amount you get.  It&amp;#8217;s a little dusty to apply.  I put this on my pansies in one pot with a control group of cheaper fertilizer in a second pot.  I will try to remember to come back and repost after I observe the growth.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Pretty expensive, which I see as the main drawback.

It seemed like a whole jar of jelly was a bit much though so I used the feeder jar. My only concern with the feeder is when the ants get active. This is a problem for us using hummingbird feeders so will likely be a concern with this one as well. This is not a problem with the feeder, just with feeding sweets in general.

While this is fairly heavy-duty, I found that using &amp;#34;light duty&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;medium duty&amp;#34; hoses worked best, as the heavy duty variety don&#39;t like to bend in quite a small of a diameter as this gives.  As long as your hose isn&#39;t rigid as some heavy duty ones are, you should be able to reel it up easily.Assembly:  it was easy, but the little wrench thing that&#39;s included didn&#39;t even fit the nuts.  At least the manual even suggests you may need to use your own pliers.Overall, this looks nice, is solid, and based on limited usage thus far, is a quality product.  It would&#39;ve been nice if it would have some with mounting hardware (come on, it&#39;s four screws and you&#39;re charging over 100 bucks...); I&#39;m not convinced, even after having this, that I would buy it again based on price alone.

It is not quite as powerful as I had hoped and probably a little overrated at 4 stars. It will certainly not compare to any 2 cycle chain saw using a similar blade.On the plus side it has a long reach and the extension pole is very easy to install.  The chain, at least initially will get loose with avery short period of use and may slip the sprocket.  This will require that you use a strange allen wrench to loosen and then retighten the chain bar to readjust.  The battery charger that the unit comes with would be ok if were not for the fact that they offer a quick charge that reduces the time from eight hours to 30 minutes.  This will set you back an additional $43.  Also, you will probably want to purchase at least one if not two additional batteries.  These will set you back another $84.  When you add it all up you will be looking at somewhere around $260 about 2X what you started with which still is not that bad.  It will cut the dead branches though.  I am using it to go along my fense line and cut off the branches that died in the winter so that I can mow close to my fence when it gets warmer out.  I wanted a gas powered unit but the only available model is made by tanaka and I had a problem with the clutch and could not get the chain to spin and so I went with the Black and Decker.  There is always someone helpful to talk to as I called to inquire about extra batteries and replacement chains. While the electric drill does everything the regular electric one will do, that is not the case when you deal with heavier work like that required by the pruner or the chain saw.  In these cases the difference is much more noticeable.  The thing is that I am getting older and am trying to avoid having to start a 2 cycle engine.  I have been fighting them for more than 40 years and am tired of the effort.  I will just take my time and stick with this black and decker, that, with a little patience, will get the job done and should prove to be reliable.  There just aren&#39;t that many moving parts to break.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;dont get too excited&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389052800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

I found that the lowest setting is still powerful enough for routine lawn maintenance and the lowest setting makes the machine even quieter and allows for a longer lasting battery. When I used used the machine at full power setting non-stop, the battery got hot and I had to wait over 30 minutes for the battery to cool down before the recharger would work.  Remember to wear safety glasses.]After reading all of the negative reviews, I decided to buy this anyway but my expectations were very low.I already own a good gas powered string trimmer, but I can&#39;t stand the noise and the maintenance associated with gas powered devices.  I bought the Black &amp; Decker LST136W for the minor jobs.I had expected (from reading the reviews) that the assembly was going to be a bear.  Not at all. I was able to assemble the unit within a minute or two, without having to open the manual.Based upon the negative reviews, I was expecting that the unit would only be able to handle light-weight growth, and the useable battery life would be very short.  Not at all. The weed whacker cut through everything and I was exhausted before the battery finally ran out of power.When I use my gas powered string trimmer, I have to use a face guard since the string guard is so narrow.  Also, the gas trimmer covers my clothing in grass trimmings (I have to shake out my clothing before putting into the washing machine).  The B&amp;D; trimmer&#39;s guard is very wide and only a small amount of debris was thrown onto my clothing.  I still use an eye guard.Power:  I was genuinely shocked by the amount of power.  Even though the B&amp;D; has just one narrow string (my gas unit uses two strings and is much thicker), the B&amp;D; string trimmer cut through all of the weeds without any hesitation.Adjustments:  I like the way I was able to adjust the length of the pole so that I don&#39;t have to lean over.Based on the negative reviews here, I anticipated that the B&amp;D; would be the backup unit but after having used the B&amp;D; light-weight unit, no motor noise (I can now use the unit early in the morning in suburbia), the convenience of not having to deal with advancing the string, I found that the reverse is true:  The gas unit will be my back-up machine.  Battery powered devices have greatly advanced in the past few years.I wasn&#39;t able to find anything negative to say about the machine after one day&#39;s use.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Surprisingly powerful, surprising long battery life.  I LOVE IT.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402531200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 12, 2014&quot;}</td>

Since the feeder is hanging over grass, it&#39;s not a big problem to clean up, but it is messy.I haven&#39;t found any orioles visiting the feeder, but the other birds seem to enjoy it. Likewise the squirrels visit the area under the feeder.

Yes, I admit it... I hate painting. However I also like freshly painted walls and change my decorating tastes frequently, so I&#39;ve painted every room in each of our last 3 houses at least once, usually a couple times each. I&#39;ve spilled a full gallon of paint on the carpet (thank goodness for owning carpet cleaners), I&#39;ve ruined paint brushes by not washing them well enough, wasted lots of money on rollers because the thought of even trying to wash them was too daunting after being exhausted from painting rooms, I&#39;ve cursed and complained and yet still continued to paint those walls.After trying this sprayer once all I thought to myself is \&quot; YOU IDIOT!!!! WHY DIDN&#39;T YOU GET ONE OF THESE YEARS AGO??? \&quot;, I did try another sprayer once... I believe it was a B&amp;D; that was passed on to me from my stepdad... it was horrible, you had to thin out your paint, it clogged every 5 seconds, it was worse to wash out that 100 thick napped roller covers, I think I threw it away.... well if you&#39;ve had an experience like that in the past don&#39;t let it cloud your sunny future with this sprayer. It&#39;s nothing like that.The directions are detailed and clear, parts are easy to figure out and put together. The longest part of the painting process is your prep, do a really good job with this since it&#39;s easier to keep paint off something than it is to remove it from something. I do recommend doing some tests before starting on your actual project so you get a feel for how the sprayer works, the different ways you can spray, etc.It&#39;s winter here now so I&#39;m only able to use this indoors but for once I can&#39;t wait for the warmer weather so we can refinish our deck (a task I had been dreading when It hought I&#39;d have to do each spindle by hand), I expect it to go so much faster and easier now... and I have some furniture I was thinking I&#39;d have to use cans of spray paint to refinish that I now play to use this sprayer for instead!Buy one, you won&#39;t regret it!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Why did I ever wait so long, I LOVE this thing!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389657600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 14, 2014&quot;}</td>

Bag soils from this company can get too dry in hot weather, the chemical fertilizers included are not organic and tend to kill off naturally active insects and other soil creatures which actually help break down nutrients and make them easier for roots to take up. If you see a MiracleGro garden where someone has been heavily using that product, you&#39;ll see a garden where there are few earthworms because the pH is not right and the chemicals make them retreat. As well, once you get trees, shrubs and perennials used to chemical fertilizers, those flora will always depend on them because you&#39;ve scared off the natural things that help them grow.

And for me, it did much better than expected.The paint went on with very even coverage as long as you just sweep the sprayer back and forth.  As opposed to hand painting, the amount of paint used versus the amount of paint needed is significant - I used maybe half of what I had used prior with a paintbrush.  Granted, the coat of paint is much thinner, but that&#39;s also a good thing - it dried much faster, and if needed, I can apply another coat.  (So far, I don&#39;t see any reason to apply another coat.)The setup of this was easy - just add some paint, screw on the sprayer you want to use (small one for detailing jobs, big one for big jobs), and have at it.  You can change the amount of paint being sprayed as well as the force that the turbine blows the paint out (which, for latex paint, needs to stay at one of the more powerful settings.)All in all, this is a great painting system, and for the admittedly limited number of painting projects I&#39;ve been able to use it on so far, I&#39;d recommend it highly.  If you&#39;re painting more than a few walls, you&#39;ll probably get a return on investment for this system since you&#39;ll be using much less paint (and it goes a lot faster than manually painting, too!)  Great product!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Excellent sprayer, even coverage&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1388620800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

I bought this lawn mower after wasting thousands of dollars on gas mowers over the years. The gas mowers were difficult to start, unreliable, and a pain to maintain. This electric mower has literally changed my life. It is lightweight and easy to maneuver. I don&#39;t get headaches from gasoline since it uses none. There is practically no maintenance at all. My favorite part is pressing a button to turn it on, just like a blender. If I am mowing the lawn and need to stop to move debris or if someone comes up to talk to me, I can turn the mower off without fear of not being able to start it again for a while. LIFE CHANGING. Never again will my neighbors point and laugh while I perform the rip cord dance on my front lawn. Never again will I plan my mowing pattern around the hill of my yard, to make sure the gas doesn&#39;t flood the engine.The cut is even and beautiful. Yes, if my lawn is thick and I have gone several weeks without mowing during peak growing season, I have to walk more slowly. But it is definitely more than powerful enough for regular lawn mowing and I would never call it underpowered. I always use the mulching mode and it looks as though the grass clippings have disappeared.The first time I mowed with the cord, I wondered if I had made a mistake. There is a trick to it. Cut your yard in half from the point where the cord plugs in. Begin at that center point and mow line by line outward away from it until you have mowed that entire half of the lawn. Then, return to the center point and begin line by line on the other half. In this way, the cord is always behind you. After 3-4 mowings I was so used to the cord that it isn&#39;t a bother at all.The wheel height adjusts from one wheel and is the simplest control of its kind in any push mower I have used.I wish I had bought one of these years ago!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;So Far So Good&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403136000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 19, 2014&quot;}</td>

Recently I fired what will probably be the last of the gardeners I ever hire (welcome to SoFL and lazy lawncare help).  I own a John Deere tractor which takes care of 90% of my mowing needs about the property.  However, the other 10% is landscaped and pathwayed and very difficult to maintain (especially in summer) with a string trimmer (my tractor would demolish these areas).  This little mower has a small diameter blade and is perfect for mowing on either side of pathway pavers and small grassy patches.  The mower was pretty much assembled in the box - all you have to do is attach the grass catcher, bolt on the arms, and charge the batteries.  Easy!  The only reason I didn&#39;t give the mower 5 stars was due to battery life.  I fully charged both batteries prior to use.  The first battery died after about 200 sq ft of usage and the 2d battery died after about 300 ft of usage.  I am currently recharging both batteries and will update this review if battery life improves.  Nonetheless, the area I needed to clean up is done for another week and took me little time to whip into shape with this machine.  I will probably buy one more battery and another charger should battery life not improve on this 2d charging round.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Useful&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399852800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 12, 2014&quot;}</td>

Plastic covers are useless - they tear easily and rot pretty fast in the sun. The 2 ton canvas one we had last worked ok for covering the grill but it was heavy, got rotten after about 3 years and I think, because it kept the air off the grill, contributed to the rust problem we had.This cover is so light weight that at first I was afraid it would just blow off but, wonder of wonders, they actually put velcro in exactly the right places on the ends to tighten the fabric and hold it in place.

The description mentions &amp;#34;Get up to 70 minutes of run time with the G-MAX 40-volt high-capacity 4 Ah and low capacity 2 Ah Li-Ion Batteries (included with purchase)&amp;#34; which I didn&#39;t take as it includes one of each capacity battery. You get one of each which I was not exactly happy about. Additionally, extra 4 AHr batteries cost $149.99 list.On to the real stuff.I started looking at this when considering the various cordless electric mowers that are available. I like it better than the lead-acid battery based cordless mowers due to the size and weight of the batteries and the maintenance required for them. Our gas powered mower was getting annoying with starter cord breaks, oil and gas maintenance, and the self-propelled portion was starting to wear out. It was important to me to go green and make things simpler than gas powered.ProsOut of the box, this was so easy to set up. There was even a slight charge on the batteries to try it out (still, fully charge before use). It said &amp;#34;team lift&amp;#34; on the box but it wasn&#39;t that heavy. No tools were need to get this prepped for action.The first thing I noticed was the &amp;#34;push the button, pull a lever and mow&amp;#34; simplicity. There was no priming, no pulling the a starter, possibly multiple times, and no flooding. It just turned on and I was ready to go.Next thing I noticed was how light it really is. Coming off the weight of a heavy, self-propelled (weakly), all metal mower going to this largely plastic one was a gift. I didn&#39;t even notice it wasn&#39;t self-propelled. My initial thought was that it could easily have been built by Fisher-Price since it reminded me of my son&#39;s toy from so many years ago. Pushing it around is very easy.This thing is super quiet. Even more fun, it sounds like a bumblebee compared to the gas powered monstrosity I had previously. I even had a neighbor approach me after a mowing once with concerns that I was &amp;#34;losing it&amp;#34; thinking that, with my headphones on, I was pushing around a mower that wasn&#39;t running. I confirmed my sanity and explained the battery powered mower really does save your hearing.ConsI saw several references to uneven cuts and I would have to agree. Although some speculate that it is because the blades don&#39;t overlap, I think it is because of the mostly solid bottom of the deck. Most unevenness I found has been when dealing with dandelions that are so much longer than the rest of the grass. They tend to be missed if off to the side or dead center. There will also be some missed blades of grass on each pass, but I&#39;m not meticulous about my lawn so it isn&#39;t an issue.There are quirks, too. I had the mower quit twice when it transitioned between batteries (the control circuitry uses one battery then switches when it runs out). Granted, it was early on and since then, I have only had it slow some, then kick in with the second battery.I also noticed that it adjusts the blade speed when the grass gets thicker. This is a great idea to maintain an even cut, except there is a time lag when you hit a change in the lawn. I have started working the system so that when I hit thicker lawn, I slow a little while the motor controller spools up the rpm&#39;s to handle the load. Minor issue, but the alternative is to have a machine that is psychic.The amount of time off full charge is a little less than advertised. It could be a smooth, even lawn that it was tested on so my irregular lawn might be what cuts the time down. I don&#39;t have a huge lawn, but it takes multiple sessions to mow it. Inconvenient, but I also don&#39;t get tired. If the weather cooperates, I get it done all in one day. Other times, it takes a couple.Overall, I am quite happy with this mower. I wish it had (2) 4 AHr  batteries instead of (1) 4 AHr and (1) 2 AHr. I also wish the motor controller was more responsive to changes in lawn resistance and better at the transition between batteries.None of this would prevent me from buying it again.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great, lightweight mower for city lawns.

This is my 6th bird type product from the Perk Pet folks.  I thought a little watering station for my thirsty flying friends would be wonderful.First, I am used to the durable and attractive feeders I have gotten from them in the past, so the lightweight blue plastic was a bit of a letdown for me.  It seems to be just as robust as my other feeders, but it&amp;#8217;s lacking in some of the elegance of their other feeders.  It really doesn&amp;#8217;t look like it was made by the same people.It&amp;#8217;s easy to put together, fill and clean.  And since we have had a TON of rain this spring it has kept itself filled nicely.  It&amp;#8217;s been a little chilly yet this spring so I haven&amp;#8217;t seen any birds drinking yet, but like I had to wait a bit to get hummingbirds for the first time, I know that it may take a bit to get my birds stopping by for beverage as long as they&amp;#8217;re dining in for a meal.Cherise Everhard, May 2014&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Not my favorite, but...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400976000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 25, 2014&quot;}</td>

I saw these cubes and not realizing they were as small as they are, decided to order them too because they are pretty well priced and I figured having a variety of traps would be good.Well, I set my chipmunk trap and the next morning the bait was gone and the trap wasn&#39;t sprung. Although these traps seem like they would be too small for a chipmunk, I decided to put one with bait inside the chipmunk trap, hoping maybe he would work to get the bait and spring the trap.Well, to my surprise, I checked the trap a while later and there was a mouse in it! I didn&#39;t even know I had mice! So took the little bugger out to a distance field and released him and then set all 4 of the traps. A few hours later, they were all full again.They work wonderfully, but I appear to have a larger mouse infestation that I am thankful to have discovered. I just ordered a multiple catch trap as well as 2 more packs of these so I can get rid of more at a time.About the traps: I use a small piece of cracker smeared with just a tiny bit of peanut butter in each trap. The traps have a flap door which I believe allow for sufficient ventilation. The traps must be checked each day or the mouse could expire, without access to food and water.Some people have questioned why teh traps dont have holes in the solid plastic for ventilation. I am personally glad they don&#39;t have holes because the mice produce a disgusting amount of urine and feces, which can spread diseases to humans. I&#39;m glad all of this is contained within the trap and not leaking out on the floor or cupboard. I always wear disposable rubber gloves when handling these traps. I do not wash the traps between use because it is winter and I would not want to use my sinks for this. You are actually supposed to wear a face mask when cleaning these mouse droppings as some of the viruses contained in the feces (havanta virus) become airborne when vaccum or swept.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Works like a charm&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390780800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 27, 2014&quot;}</td>

The cutting diameter is 17&amp;#34;.I&#39;m very happy with this mower. It represents quite a set of changes from mowers in the past:1) Lightweight, low profile and great handle bar. This mower weighs only 32 pounds because of its many plastic parts including the wheels. The bar is steel, making it easy to maneuver.2) Low profile and easy single lever height adjustment. The product photos barely do it justice in terms of showing the low profile. It&#39;s better to have a low profile for getting under shrubs. It also makes it feel like an edger when edging. The height adjustment allows selection of the cut from 11/10&amp;#34; to 31/10&amp;#34;.3) The bale switching compacts grass clippings and allows more grass to be collected between emptying. That saves time and effort.4) Comes with 2 year limited warranty. Several action may cause the warranty to be voided, such as changing the wheel size.5) B &amp; D recommends that when the mower is off and unplugged, that the blades be wiped with a damp cloth. This will extend their useful life. Don&#39;t touch with bare hands - sharp.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Works well.

I also notice that I don&#39;t have any weeds popping up where I spread the Lawn Restore, but have scattered dandelions where I was unable to spread the fertilizer.I will post another update in a week or two.Update 2: This will be the final update. The Lawn Restore did a solid job in thickening up my lawn where there were patches. The grass is thicker, the lawn more full where I laid down the fertilizer. I will say that the dandelions have spread to the fertilized area, so I&#39;m not sure if this is what you would want for a week repellant, but it worked great on thickening up my grass.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;An Ongoing Review&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396828800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

It is also easier to set with the unique handle-based setting mechanisms. The small size I review here is too small for anything larger than a squirrel or perhaps a chipmunk: it will not entrap a groundhog or opossum or raccoon. But it worked perfectly for that pesky red squirrel who had been trying to dig his way into my porch attic (he had already chased off all of the more desirable grey and fox squirrels). I baited the Havaheart with bird seed-one of his favorite foods and set it along the trail he usually follows to the porch. Within a few hours, he was caught-and removed to a plot of state land a couple miles away. Within a couple of days the more desirable squirrels had figured out the treetop terror had disappeared and  were back to playing among the trees. And this time, the patch my son applied to the porch eaves will stay secure.Have-a-Heart makes great quality live traps that do NOT injure animals. Other live traps are of lesser quality and cant be expected to give the years of service the Havaheart will. I expect to be using the trap for many years to come and will be replacing my two larger traps with the Havaheart brand.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Very well made and humane!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401926400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 5, 2014&quot;}</td>

It was a Black and Decker MM675 with a flip-over handle. That lawn mower served me well for about 5 years and never let me down. Then, one day I used it when my lawn was too wet and the motor started to smoke as it bogged down on wet grass! I could no longer get the MM675 model, so I went to Home Depot and &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; to the MM1800, the 18&amp;#34; corded mulching/bagging mower from Black and Decker. Immediately I was dissatisfied. It didn&#39;t feel as strong as my old mower, was more unwieldy, and had this awful plastic shroud that made it hard to maneuver. Everything on it felt cheap, and two years later, it died on me while mowing grass that was not that thick.I decided to try to leave the Black and Decker world and see what else I could find.Bear in mind, I did not consider gas because I don&#39;t have the room to keep fuel around and I have a modest size yard. I did not want cordless battery power because I didn&#39;t want to have to keep batteries alive (some require charge/discharge cycles all winter) or buy new batteries.Corded lawn mowers are a fine solution. Many complain about &amp;#34;cord management&amp;#34;, but here&#39;s the trick. Your lawn never changes. Unless you are a professional landscaper (and if you are, buy a gas mower), then you always mow the same lawn. So the trick is to come up with a mowing pattern where you mow away from the outlet and never trip over the cord. Once you have a pattern, stick with it and you can mow quickly.I finally discovered the Greenworks 25022 20&amp;#34; electric bag/mulch/side discharge mower. You can read my review there of that amazing lawn mower.  Since I have used the Greenworks for the past 3 years, I can only review Sun Joe by comparing it.The first thing I noticed about the SunJoe mower is that it was  far lighter than the Greenworks.  At 33lbs, it is exactly 23 lbs lighter and you can easily notice that as you move it around.  The SunJoe is really easy to transport around the yard and push on a steep hill.  It also has very large tires which makes it easy to push.  Unfortunately the tire tread is not rubber but rather hard plastic, so they aren&amp;#8217;t the best tires in the world, but at least the size makes the mower relatively easy to maneuver.The mower was easy to assemble &amp;#8211; just attached 4 hand-tightened bolts to assemble the handle and you are done.  The handle is a standard &amp;#34;push the button and pull the safety bar&amp;#34; handle.  The mower plugs in with a pig-tail cable, a very secure way of handling the power.  The mower is set by default to mulch, but there is a bag you can use.  The bag was a bit of a let down &amp;#8211; there is a snap-in handle which just loved to unsnap as I used it.  There is also no side-discharge option like the Greenworks has - you can only mulch or bag.The mower also has an easy one-handle height adjust which made changing cutting heights very simple.In terms of performance, I found the mower did a decent job, but was significantly louder than any other electric mower I have tried.  This may be due to the all-plastic body construction.  I mowed my lawn while dry but a bit long and found that the mower did bog down on some of the heavier grass.  Trying an uncut patch nearby, I found my old Greenworks cut right through it.Overall, this mower gets a strong 4 stars.  It is lightweight, easy to use, and does a nice job on grass that isn&amp;#8217;t too long.  My Greenworks mower still gets my vote due to the all-metal deck, the rubberized tires, the quieter operation, and more powerful motor.  But the light weight of the SunJoe will be less intimidating to many buyers, so I can definitely recommend it if weight is a concern..&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;There are better electric mowers, but this one shines in its light weight design&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403740800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

I have corded and cordless lawnmowers, trimmers, edgers, blowers, etc, from major brands such as Black and Decker and Greenworks.  I regularly mow my lawn with a Greenworks 25022 lawn mower and trim it with a Black and Decker plug-in string trimmer.  I have never owned a Remington trimmer, but I thought I would give it a try.On removal from the box, I was impressed at the ease of assembly.  No need to break out a screwdriver - the nylon cutting line is pre-wound and installed, and the plastic guard snaps on with ease.  The handle is tightened down with a simple knob.  As I picked up the trimmer and went outside to try it, I noticed the first strike against the trimmer.  It is heavy.  At 9 lbs, it is literally 2x the weight of the comparable corded string trimmers from Black and Decker.  Unlike some tools, extra weight does NOT help with a string trimmer.  It makes it a pain to use.I plugged in the trimmer which was easy thanks to the plug pig-tail, a nice feature over the plug moulded-into-plastic which B&amp;D; uses.  The pig-tail means you can get a good attachment to a cord and it is less likely to fall out.  I trimmed my grass with ease, and then flipped it over to try some edging.  Once again, the 9# of weight make this a bit awkward, but I persevered.  There is a nice wheel on the front for making this easier - my B&amp;D; has no such wheel, but then again, it is lighter so the wheel is less necessary.Of course, edging against a sidewalk will wear down the line, and I quickly found myself with a shorter and shorter line.  Unfortunately, the sophisticated &amp;#34;auto-feed&amp;#34; system did absolutely nothing.  I flipped over trimmer, tried my best to manually feed some line (not easy when it&#39;s an auto-feeder&amp;#34;), but when it ran short again, it still refused to feed more line.It&#39;s not really for me to debug - every other trimmer I have owned just works.  This is a $40 trimmer that does not work so I cannot recommend it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Heavy and unwieldy with auto-feed that will not feed - buy another brand&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398384000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 25, 2014&quot;}</td>

They are relatively light, rigid, but with a little give, and the pair of them can easily withstand the weight of a ten pound piece of meat (the largest size I tried lifting with them.)While these are excellent for lifting and transporting meat, they were designed to shred it and that they do. Once you get the hang of using them - a very slight learning curve - you can shred meat like a hungry raptor. There is sufficient room between the handle portion and the claws to keep you from burning or scalding your knuckles as long as you hold them perpendicular to the meat while you are working on it. Coming at a large piece of meat from a lesser angle can blister your knuckles. Also, the claws are pretty sharp and require the same level of respect as a razor sharp knife. But if you exercise caution and common sense these are completely safe.Although they are of nylon they will not easily melt. They can withstand 450 degrees F, so they are dishwasher safe. I will caution you to thoroughly clean them with a strong jet of water on the back side because there are channels behind the claws that can collect meat. Even if you machine wash them, take care to remove meat from that part of the claws because that is a weak point from a sanitary perspective. Again, common sense and diligent attention to sanitation will prevent problems.I tried these out the same day they arrived and am impressed. So nuch so that I intend to recommend a pair to family and friends because they and not only handy, but essential if you prepare shredded or pulled barbeque.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Absolutely perfect&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396569600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

And despite it being so light weight it survived some very high winds during a recent storm (with hail) the other day. The claims about UV and rust are too early to tell. However, so far so good. I am impressed with this grill cover so far and in my opinion I think the claims will hold up.This is expensive (though I received the cover without charge to give an honest review).  Even so I think it is a worthwhile expense considering you would not need to keep replacing it if the claims hold up, which I suspect they will.Great product.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Lightweight, durable and survivived high winds.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404604800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

For that reason, I prefer the smaller, easier to handle electric type. I didn&#39;t have any complaints about myAR Blue Clean AR383 1,900 PSI 1.5 GPM 14 Amp Electric Pressure Washer with Hose Reel, but I was glad to give this Karcher with similar specs and profile a try.Really the only thing I didn&#39;t like was the amount of assembly required and the crappy instructions for putting it together. I don&#39;t know when it became fashionable for companies to give all their assembly and operation instructions with pictures only, but I&#39;d wish they&#39;d stop and just tell us what to do. Fortunately, assembling the pieces of this pressure washer was not that bad, as there are only a few ways things can go together in the first place. All in all assembly took only around thirty minutes and I didn&#39;t use nearly as many bad words as I&#39;ve used with other products.Once it was together, this pressure washer was very easy to operate: plug it in, press the button, connect and turn on the hose and turn on the washer. You can use the adjustable sprayer for focused or low power washing, or you can use the rotating head for a powerful, clean \&quot;sweeping\&quot; action. Both heads worked great and having the adjustable flow was very useful when I used it to wash my car. Typical operation for cleaning the stairs and sidewalk was as expected: move back for a wider, slower spray, move in for a narrower, faster spray. Everything just worked. This one is slightly more powerful than my blue pressure washer, but just as easy to operate. A slightly longer cord and/or hose would have made it ideal, but I don&#39;t really have any complaints. This is a good product, but I&#39;m deducting one star for the amount of assembly and the fussy, cartoonish instructions. Otherwise, this is quite a good pressure washer.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;This pressure washer is a blast&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397001600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

Walker&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [1, 1], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;Even considering just Motomco&#39;s rodent control products, there&#39;s enough to drive a person crazy. Snap traps, glue traps, spin traps, and several different types of bait stations. Of them all, poisons are perhaps the last I&#39;d choose (except maybe the glue traps... I hate to see animals suffer like that). While I&#39;m not a fan of poisons (I prefer snap traps), there are four different, very similar products, and it&#39;s hard to keep them straight:Mouse Killer (this product): Disposable, kid and pet safe, and can be used both indoors and outdoors.Mouse Killer I(Best choice!): Refillable, kid and pet safe, and both indoors/outdoors.Mouse Killer II: Disposable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoors only.Mouse Killer III: Refillable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoor only.Of the four, Mouse Killer I makes the most sense to me. It&#39;s as safe as they get, and refillable (and therefore more cost-effective in the long run). They all come with the same poison, so there&#39;s no difference there. This one has an additional covering over the entrance the others don&#39;t have, making it a little more tamper resistant, and a bit more attractive to mice, which like such things.The disadvantage of poisons? They don&#39;t work right away, and the rodents may go off and die in a place where you can&#39;t get to them, but their rotting corpses still stink up your house.My preferred option is stillsnap traps, which are infinitely reusable without purchasing additional products (poisons, etc), and much cheaper, especially when obtained at a local hardware store.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Not the one I&#39;d choose.

On the bottom I put this outdoor mix, since we don&#39;t plant tomatoes outside here until June, and it will set the roots in something suitable for outdoors. The top couple inches of soil is a 50/50 mix of the starter mix andMiracle-Gro Moisture Control Potting Mix, which has more fertilizer and adds water retention, since seedlings are so sensitive to drying out. (The fertilizer in this mixture has more nitrogen than they&#39;ll get once they&#39;re planted outside.)They&#39;re doing great in this mixture, with more than twice as much leaf growth as the ones in the local nursery medium.This product looks like a rough peat mix, with a few under-one-inch wood pieces. The main ingredient is listed as any or all of peat, processed forest products, coir (coconut husk fibers), and/or compost. The other listed ingredients are sphagnum peat moss, a wetting agent (to help soak in water), and fertilizer: .09 - .05 - .07 NPK, polymer-coated for slow release over three months. (Keep in mind that the NPK composition of growth medium and soil cannot be directly compared to that of fertilizer additives, which are a lot more concentrated so they can be diluted in the soil.)&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Working fine with tomato seedlings&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397606400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

An easy enough fix but every one who buys this might not have that option available to them. Now that I took care of the slippage I am finding many uses besides the intended bulb planting.

Ryan \&quot;AJRyan\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [3, 4], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;This is the first paint sprayer system I&#39;ve owned, so this review is coming from the perspective of a novice.First, I found the system very easy to assemble. The instructions were very clear, and I had no problem understanding how to put the system together and use it. I did have a bit of problem mastering the technique of paint spraying, and I don&#39;t think I fully have it yet, but I&#39;m sure that will come in time. I tended to want to hold the sprayer a bit closer to the surface of the object I was spraying (in this case some shutters and trim on the outside of my garage) than was advised in the instructions, which resulted in the paint being sprayed a bit more thickly than I wanted. Again, that&#39;s my fault and not the sprayer. The instructions, as I said were very clear as to how to use the sprayer. Also, even though I was warned by a few people that there would be a lot of overspray, I didn&#39;t mask the non-painted areas off as well as I probably should have. The Flexio is pretty accurate as far as where the paint goes, but there is still a fair amount of overspray, so I will be more careful next time.Cleanup was easy, although there are a lot of little parts that need to be disassembled. Again, great instructions from Wagner, so I wasn&#39;t afraid to completely break the Flexio down to clean it. I was happy that Wagner also included a small brush to use to help clean away all the paint from the unit. Once it was disassembled and flushed/brushed out, the whole unit came away very clean, and it was easy to put it back together again.As a novice to paint sprayers, I was very pleased with the Flexio 590, and I can honestly say that it is a great product, and easy to operate, even for someone with little to no experience. I can&#39;t wait to tackle more paint jobs with it!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Be careful of overspray&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389052800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

I&#39;m sure it&#39;s to increase the ease of use, but I find it annoying. I&#39;d be happier with the plain old brass only fitting &amp; I may opt to cut it off.Overall, I&#39;m happy with this hose.  It much lighter than the old commercial grade rubber hose I was using + it doesn&#39;t kink! :)&amp;#9658; Update - May 27, 2014I decided to cut off that piece of plastic on the female fitting.

I like this particular feeder because the wide mouth makes cleaning and filling easy, the base separates in half (again for easy cleaning) and it has built in bee guards and an ant moat.  Most important, hummingbirds like it.  We have over ten different feeders hanging around the yard, and it&#39;s obvious which ones are preferred.  Their favorite feeders aren&#39;t the fanciest or most expensive, but they all resemble this fundamental glass tube style.UPDATE:  This feeder leaks like a sieve!  It held liquid just fine for about a month, but now the two-part base just doesn&#39;t seal.  I checked reviews, and sure enough, lots of other people are experiencing the same problem.

It does not keep out squirrels, but in 25 years I haven&#39;t found a feeder that really does.  Hairy houdinis can crack the code on just about everything.  Instead, I&#39;ve learned to hang feeders beyond squirrel reach or use above and below baffling.  Unless one does that, the little baffle and wire grate on this feeder are ineffective.Why do I like it then?  This metal feeder is sturdy, of simple design, holds very little seed, and birds flock to it.  They seem to prefer open platform feeders, and this one has a nice low lip.  I have other expensive cedar platform feeders, but their sides measure 2\&quot;.  That may not seem like much, but birds do not like feeling confined, and they&#39;re always on the lookout for a quick escape if predators approach.  Consequently, this platform is much more popular than the cedar ones.Having clean and fresh seed in platform feeders is important, so its smaller 1/2 lb seed capacity is ideal.  The wire grate is removable.  I&#39;ve elected to keep it off permanently which makes for very easy cleaning or tossing of sunflower hulls.  There are small drainage holes in the bottom, but I drilled in a few more, and it was a very easy process.This small feeder sits outside our kitchen window, and has endless bird traffic from dawn until dusk.  They love the feeder, and I sure enjoy watching them while doing the dishes.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Squirrel-proof?

It&#39;s not due to risk of freeze but rather to risk of birds eating the seeds or the sprouts drying out. Once the seedlings are well-established, then I transplant outside.I used this mix to start some Papaver somniferum (annual poppies), and it worked as well as anything I&#39;ve tried in the past.The reason there is a special mix for seed-starting (as opposed to regular potting mix) is that the fertilizer should be a little weaker, so it doesn&#39;t burn the delicate roots of seedlings.Because I could not find the ingredients on this product page or anywhere else online, I took a photo; you&#39;ll find it in the consumer photos. It&#39;s mostly sphagnum peat, with some perlite.As another reviewer mentioned, the mix is a little heavy on the peat for my tastes. It&#39;s easy enough to add perlite or vermiculate, another moisture-enhancing soil amendment, if you have it. Perlite looks like little white styrofoam balls, but it is actually a very porous volcanic material that resembles pumice.  It helps avoid soil compaction, improves aeration, and retains moisture, but it promotes better drainage than vermiculite.Whether or not you want to add perlite depends on the container and environment in which you are starting the seeds (e.g. the air temperature, humidity, amount of sunlight, etc.) as well as the kind of plants you are growing. Some love having their \&quot;feet wet\&quot;; some don&#39;t.Overall, this seems a good medium for starting most seeds. The important thing is not over- or under-watering.Happy sprouting!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Good choice for novice gardeners planting from seed&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393891200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

A Q-tip works almost as well and is disposable. (I&#39;m just nervous about contamination after my experience with spreading plant diseases all over my garden, so I&#39;m not going to be dipping any wet cuttings into the jar per the instructions.)It&#39;s a new experience trying to root cuttings for the garden, and like any new gardening skill it has to be learned and practiced.

They tend to be a good bit more expensive but I&#39;m not really wanting that around my free range chickens.  I&#39;ve used the Miracle Grow Shake &#39;N Feed for a few years now with good results.For what it is worth, it compares almost as well as frequent, sparse natural chicken poop.  I&#39;ve got knockout roses where my chickens hide under it and then the same roses of the same age in the same soil outside the fence that are never visited by the birds.I put this product around and under the roses that are OUTSIDE the fence.  The roses with this bloom just as beautifully and are lush and healthy, though just not quite as big as the ones that get the continual chicken tending.  This tells me that the nitrogen content is very much what a rose wants and needs to really turn on the blooms and produce the foliage.It&#39;s easy to apply- I love the new lid which keeps you from dumping the product out too fast.  The pellets come out and go over the cap and it helps distribute it.  Generally with my 5 large knockouts, 2 climbers, and an Old English Rose, I can get through the Southern (long) growing season with just one jug.If, however, you grow more finicky tea roses and/or have problems with aphids, Japanese beetles, or other bugs, and have no reason not to use it, you might prefer the food with the systemic insect and disease control in it.I grow sedum, snapdragons, coleus, fennel, and begonias around my roses and they get this and seem to like it as well.  It has never hurt any of my flowers.  My mini-roses are in the same beds and they like it every bit as much as the larger roses do- just watch that you don&#39;t over apply it - there&#39;s a picture on the jug showing how it should look on the ground if applied right - it&#39;s a great guide and easy to compare just with sight.  The main thing is - don&#39;t dump it or clump it- scatter it thinly.I also put mine out before I know it&#39;s going to rain.  By the end of the week, I&#39;ll have tons of blooms.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great for Knock-out roses, pure feed&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398902400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

I have a small yard that I typically mow with an old-fashioned, manual push mower. Oftentimes I will go over the yard with a trimmer before I use the push mower  to handle thick and weedy patches. This trimmer does a great job in that respect.CONS1. LINE WON&#39;T FEED. I have to take the line housing apart at least 3 times every single time I trim. And my yard is not large! This is infinitely frustrating and renders this trimmer almost unusable for anything but the smallest of projects.2. EDGING IS HORRIBLE. First off, trying to edge just chews the line to pieces...resulting in repeated problems with CON #1. In addition, I can never seem to get a nice, straight edge despite following the instructions in the manual. Just can&#39;t do it.3. HEAVY. This thing weighs a LOT for an electric trimmer. Wow. The weight makes it somewhat difficult to control. (I&#39;ve also used a trimmer that was too light, and equally difficult to control. So there&#39;s obviously a sweet spot. And it&#39;s not being met here.)&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Line feed doesn&#39;t work, edging is horrible&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399766400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 11, 2014&quot;}</td>

I recently used this rooting hormone to grow a new knockout rose from a clipping that I took from one of my huge ones out front. It was extremely simple to do and anyone can do it. I clipped a nice little section from my rose bush. I clipped it at an angle just below one of the little branches. Then I got the bottom of the clipping wet and dusted it with a light but even layer of this rooting hormone. After that I planted the clipping in potting soil. I watered it daily to keep the roots moist. About two weeks later I checked up on it and it had grown very nice looking roots on it. For the time being I am allowing it to continue growing in the potting soil and will plant it in my flower bed when I am sure it&amp;#8217;s not going to frost again.

No pull! The cut is very clean and even and you should see it to understand how even it really is. Much better than my gas mower.I didn&#39;t use the grass catcher because I&#39;d be dumping all the time. I didn&#39;t get grass on me anyway. The mulch dropped right down and didn&#39;t spray up. The mower is so light and easy to use that I was able to steer it with only one hand!I don&#39;t usually gush over these kinds of things but I showed my brother this mower and he bought one and was so impressed by this that he bought the blower and weed whacker as well! All of them work very well and we don&#39;t miss messing with gasoline mix and pull tabs to start!I did have to use two batteries to do my whole yard. You only get about 12-15 minutes of use on a battery charge. The extra batteries I got with the other items come in very handy. This is the only down side.

One trap is supposed to snap the mouse and thus kill it, and then you go and dispose of it in your trash (hopefully, while wearing gloves!).I would caution you to watch your fingers and set the traps very carefully. Also, sometimes, mice do not die in the trap, and are pinned against in it instead. Be very careful when handling the trap with the mouse in it. Traps in general are a hit or miss and this one is no exception.Also, beware that using peanut butter or cheese will attract pets. Place the trap in a place where the pet can&#39;t get to it.Warn children not to go anywhere near it as well -- you don&#39;t want the child getting his or her fingers snapped off or handling a dead mouse, or worse, getting bitten by a trapped mouse.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;the old-tried-and-true method of catching rodents&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404604800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

I finally turned the water on and after a few minutes of running water through it the hose straightened out.I really have no complaints over this hose except the price. I typically spent $20 on a hose, and like I said the ones I have used previously always kink so I do think this one is built better which would justify a higher cost, but at $33.99 it&#39;s a bit more then I think it should cost. That being said it is a great hose and if the cost doesn&#39;t chase you away then I would recommend you get it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Built solid, great brass connectors.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395187200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 19, 2014&quot;}</td>

I once tried a glue trap like this for a mouse and was horrified - did you know mice can scream?  So I don&#39;t use these glue traps in areas of rodent activity.  That being said, I get a ton of camel crickets in my basement along with hunting spiders (like wolf spiders and jumping spiders).  I place these glue boards along baseboards and behind furniture.  At the end of the month, they are covered in dead crickets and spiders.  They are excellent, especially if you have kids in the home and don&#39;t want to spray tons of chemicals.  The only downside is that they are very sticky and have open tops.  In high-traffic kid areas, I use the tri-fold cardboard because if your kid gets stuck on this trap, cleanup is not fun.I had previously used the black traps, but these new high-contrast traps are great because I can actually see what I caught a lot better.  Especially when trying to identify a spider, it&#39;s nice to have the white background and green goo.Highly recommended so long as you aren&#39;t trying to nab a rodent.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I don&#39;t use this for rodents but I love it for crickets and spiders&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403740800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

I admit I haven&#39;t tried anything there yet - if something works I will amend this review.  I have left it open but worry about mosquitoes breeding there - it&#39;s a bit deep to function as a bird bath - about 4 1/2 inches.I like the looks of the rain barrel - better than my green plastic one  - it doesn&#39;t look like cheap plastic to me, could be cement from a distance.  I like having one spigot up high - much easier to reach for filling a watering can.  It was easy to install too (for my handyman!).Update after two months:  the resevoir on top has turned out to be a breeding ground for mosquito larvae.  I would prefer a barrel where water did not collect on top.

The huge capacity of nectar is wasted since it must be changed twice a week to avoid bacteria and mold.At first, I absolutely loved that it didn&#39;t leak while hanging in its place -- and then I had to change the nectar.  The moment I moved the feeder, nectar poured out of the spouts and over my hands.  It was even messier when I turned it upside down to unlock the base.  I was covered with sugar water. I&#39;m sure the ants had a field day below.The feeder comes unassembled, with no instructions.  It was pretty easy to figure out, although if the flowers aren&#39;t all the way in, the feeder will leak right away.  Everything is plastic.  This feeder is much easier to clean than others.I just wish someone would make a bee-proof, non-leaking, easy-to-clean, easy-to-fill feeder.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Large Capacity Feeder That Won&#39;t Leak -- Until You Remove It&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399248000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 5, 2014&quot;}</td>

All that is need is cut stem from existing plant, dip into TAKEROOT and start as many new plants  as desired.  All I have to do is cut a stem off an old plant and dip into the growth hormone and let it take effect  growing little roots and producing a new plant.  My TAKEROOT hormone rooting compound came from Amazon and you can get yours there also.

I did have to readjust the hose a few times because if it has a sharp bend (kink if you will) the weep is faster before the kink than it is after (obviously).  I found that the readjustments are easy and the hose is fairly forgiving to being snaked around things without kinking.  I&#39;m so happy I purchased it.

The hummingbirds don&#39;t seem to care as long as there&#39;s fresh nectar (sugar water).This 48 ounce feeder is BIG. Unless the hummingbirds we get would consume 48 ounces within a couple of days, this size is overkill. That&#39;s because when the daily temperature hits the 90&#39;s, a couple of days is the most we can go before replacing the nectar and cleaning the feeders.I don&#39;t know about the store bought nectar because we make our own (3 parts boiling water to 1 part sugar), but it can go cloudy in as quick as a day during the hottest part of summer. Cloudy is bad, as are visible black floating specks. It means contamination.As long as the nectar doesn&#39;t get contaminated, cleaning is pretty easy, it&#39;s really just a matter of rinsing. However, once there&#39;s contamination, a full out washing is the only way to feel it&#39;s safe to use again.For me, the best feeders are the ones that are the easiest to use and the easiest to clean. This one fits the bill; it is easy to take apart, fill and clean.On the negative side, I had a knee jerk reaction to the plastic bottle. Only time will tell, but I have had plastic feeder bottles that became brittle and / or cracked in as little as one summer&#39;s use. (Probably due to our mountain location where summer temps can hit 90 during the day and drop to the 45 at night.)For my purposes, this feeder is okay. Of all the feeders that we have tried, I like Perky Pet&#39;s, but prefer their smaller ones. I start with putting a couple out in April and add as the hummer population grows.

And one of the things we&#39;ve learned is that almost EVERYTHING needs to be \&quot;scaled down\&quot; in size, for Urban Use, whether it&#39;s a patio set that only seats 2 people vs. 8 people; a small grill that can handle a couple of burgers vs. a side of beef, and even bird feeders...yes, even bird feeders.Out in the country, we have 14 feeders, ranging from multiples of suet feeders, feeding platform feeders, tube feeders and thistle feeders. Nary a pigeon, rat nor squirrel in sight, we don&#39;t have the problems of feeding birds that plagues Urban gardens.That&#39;s why, when I received this feeder, I instantly thought: BALCONY!!!, and that&#39;s indeed where it has ended up. Anyone who&#39;s ever lived in the city with a balcony knows ALL the problems: too small of a space, too shallow, usually metal railings that support nothing and slats of boards for floors so the 3rd floor is always messing up the 2nd and 1st floor balconies.THIS feeder is just PERFECT for small urban spaces, either vertical (condo) or horizontal (home) which still have no trees in their own garden, due to lack of space. Yes, it can be hung by it&#39;s sturdy and handy swivel latch, but it also has a very, very nice key-hole cut out on the back, making it perfect to hang from a simple nail against a wood balcony wall. And since it&#39;s so simple to open up the patio door and refill this feeder, it&#39;s small size is perfect for filling every other day.We&#39;ve had NO problems with this feeder. Our metal top, unlike so many other&#39;s, fits tightly and snugly...there simply is NO gap between the top and clear walls. For the type of birds we&#39;re attracting: Mourning Doves/Chickadees/Finches/and Sparrows, the ample metal perch and strong seed catcher holds every bird that lands. We&#39;re lucky, in that a crab apple tree is directly outside of our condo window, so the birds have perched on our porch, forever. We&#39;ve also had small metal trays of food on our tiny patio table, so they were used to coming to our home for food.We love this feeder. It&#39;s definitely a \&quot;niche\&quot; category; I wouldn&#39;t use it in a suburban or rural area, simply because there&#39;s too many birds that visit those yards and the shape and limited capacity would/could make this problematic. Much larger feeding tubes and platform feeders are the ones that work out there.But, for people who live in tiny spaces that LOVE birds and want to attract them, THIS is a wonderfully thought out feeder. If you have a relative or friend in assisted living, this feeder would be a welcome gift to have outside of their window to enjoy.Bottom line: Our feathered friends HIGHLY recommend it! And we enjoy being able to have our morning tea at the window, enjoying Nature, up close. :D&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Urban Chic for the Urban Peep!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394150400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

It really is very pretty!I love these glass feeders, they are so easy to fill and keep clean. I love the way the light shines through these and our selfish little hummingbird seems to prefer this blue one over his red and green feeders. He now takes a drink out of each one before he flies away.  He is so serious when it comes to keeping the other hummingbirds away from his feeders that he is never gone for more than a few minutes. He will even hover over you to check you out while you remove the feeders for cleaning and filling.I started  hanging hummingbird feeders as a fun thing to do with my granddaughter when she was was just a toddler. She loved watching the birds and hearing them fly around. Years later she still loves hummingbirds, I like to think I played a part in that.  One of these would make a wonderful gift for a child.

We use a Weber Genesis E330 in our home and a Weber Q200 for our frequent tailgating activities.  We have used the Genesis for two years with excellent results.  We have had two minor issues with the Genesis and WEBER Customer Service responded immediately and rapidly without any hassles whatsoever.  We have used the Q200 for almost TEN (10) years with outstanding results.  It is, without question, the best &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34; grill money can buy.  So, recently, when we wanted a grill for a high rise condominium balcony which prohibits propane, we immediately turned to Weber.  We decided to order the Q1400 Electric.  Right out of the box we were impressed with the rich appearance and full assembly.  The cord is relatively short (6 foot), but this is understandable for safety reasons.  We wish we would have ordered the optional cart, but a sturdy tempered glass top table served to elevate the grill to a comfortable level for cooking.  Our first meal on the new Q1400 was filet and lobster tail.  We were a bit apprehensive about the performance of the electric grill since we are accustomed to grilling on propane.  However, the Q1400 heated quickly and cooked effectively and evenly.  We could tell little difference between cooking with the electric element versus propane.  Our meal was outstanding.  We are pleased to have found the perfect solution for grilling on a condominium balcony which prohibits propane.  The ONLY negative we can offer is the fact that WEBER has long prided themselves on manufacturing their products in the USA.  This particular model is NOT manufactured in the USA.  We were disappointed to learn this as we support American manufacturing whenever possible.  With regards to all other respects of the product, we highly recommend the Weber Q1400.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;THE PERFECT SOLUTION FOR HIGH RISE AND CONDOMINIUM BALCONIES&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391558400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 5, 2014&quot;}</td>

It&#39;s pretty much fixed, although I suppose you could find different nozzles if you needed to.Otherwise, it&#39;s a good value at the price and definitely worth a try if you need this sort of sprayer.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;overall&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">5.0</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;summary&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Works well, priced fairly<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;unixReviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">1402790400</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;reviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>06 15, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

Each trap is rectangular, approximately 4 1/2\&quot; x 9\&quot;, a shallow 3/8\&quot; high plastic tray containing and ultra-sticky day-glo green glue.  It&#39;s pesticide free, and ready and easy to use immediately.Does it work?  Yes, it works great on mice, rats, insects, spiders, scorpions, etc.  It also works on pet hamsters, kittens, birds, etc -- so use caution and common sense.Personally, I use mine exclusively for insects/spiders . . . in the garage (hiding it on the floor under a shelf where it collects spiders), and adjacent to a sliding patio door that insects occasionally slip in through.  In the case of the patio door, although the trap is 3/8\&quot; high, I butt it inside against the raised lower frame rail of the door.  Insects do not have to climb to get into the trap, they simply crawl over the rail and down into the trap.  The curious and mobile spiders in the garage also have no problem getting into, and stuck in, the traps.An additional note about the plastic tray design.  I prefer it.  In my patio door application, I had previously used an Ortho Home Defense branded trap, in which the glue is simply deployed on a flat paperboard base.  Over time, the glue slowly melted and migrated onto my doorframe and carpet (where it continued to do its job, but also made a mess).So how about rodents?  Sorry, but I will not use this trap for mice, which will indeed become trapped - but also terrified and/or eventually starve to death (or even possibly escape, but with less than four feet).  With mice, I prefer to live trap and relocate.  For rats, which thankfully are not currently a problem here, I admit I will use ANYTHING (I had one invade once through a basement drain.  He laughed off the snap trap I used, but succumbed to the poison I put out).An additional note - This trap works only by trapping with the glue surface.  It contains no poison or bait.  However, I see no reason why putting a little food bait in the center of the trap would not enhance the success probability.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great for trapping invading insects (I won&#39;t use it for mice)&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404086400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

I have tried a wide variety of traps and poisons for moles, but not all of them have worked, but this one works if you leave it for couple of days. I usually leave it right next to the walls, on the outside of my garage. After three or four weeks, I have noticed that the poison has been consumed by the menacing rodent. This trap is safe and the bait station encloses the poisonous material inside (Bromethalin), and it is resistant to weather. It is preloaded and you don&#39;t have to handle the dangerous substance by hand. It is also kids and pet-proof. It contains a tier of bait-station which is about four ounce of bar bait. This is pretty large and long-lasting than one ounce station. This disposable bait station has a top which is clear translucent plastic. When the poison is consumed, you can see through the clear plastic, and usually the rodent dies in its dwelling. This can be safely disposed in the trash. Another plus is that this can be used either indoor or outdoor. This is a good alternative to glue-traps that immobilize the rodent and kills slowly and painfully. The good old-fashioned spring traps kill the pest instantly but are also dangerous to kids and the pets.

Getchell \&quot;Evie\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [3, 3], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;I&#39;m always game for trying any bird feeder that might make it more difficult for my chubby backyard squirrels to get at the birdfeed, so I was really excited to be offered this one from the Amazon Vine program in exchange for an honest review.After 6 weeks of testing this Perky-Pet 412 platform feeder I have to honestly say that it is a great squirrel feeder but a not-so-great wild bird feeder.  In fact, the only birds who even bother with this feeder in my backyard are those nuisance starlings and grackles.Depending on what I filled it with during my 6 week testing period - seed, suet, peanut nuggets or mealworms - the platform feeder did attract a few species of wild birds at first.  As a full-time resident of the Gulf coast of west central Florida where the birdlife is unusually rich and abundant, I have identified many species at my other bird feeders but only the starlings and grackles continued to visit this platform feeder, especially when I filled it with peanut nuggets or mealworms. (The squirrels, by the way, do not like the mealworms).I positioned my feeder in a nearby tree using a 36-inch \&quot;S\&quot; branch-hook which provides a lot of clearance around the feeder to foil the squirrels. The adjustable dome is designed to wobble and throw the squirrels off balance when they attempt a raid but my squirrels still manage to get under it, tilt the feeder and spill the food. I don&#39;t mind this too much though because I also enjoy watching the birds ground feed.The Perky-Pet platform feeder is made in China and requires some assembly. It is easy to assemble but the wire grate that fits overs the metal feeding dish is warped on my unit and is a very poor fit, leaving about a half inch gap allowing the squirrels a better foothold and easier access to the food. I have since removed this grate inasmuch as it serves no good purpose.The distance between the dome and the feeding dish is adjustable but the dome is also a poor fit and sits at an angle, wobbling and bouncing wildly on its spring with the slightest movement of air. It is not a bad looking feeder but I would visually like it better if all of its pieces were a straighter fit and the feeder didn&#39;t look so wonky.The feeder requires frequent cleaning which means dismantling the feeder. It&#39;s a bit of a hassle to disassemble the feeder twice a week but necessary to prevent disease transmission in birds through decayed and contaminated food.But during the process of frequent disassembling, cleaning and reassembling, I&#39;ve done a little experimenting with this feeder trying to make it a more successful feeder for wild birds and this is what I&#39;ve discovered:1. The grate really is useless so I just keep it off.2. The bouncing dome does not deter squirrels. Rather it scares the birds away. So I tried keeping the dome off in order to attract more birds. This didn&#39;t really work for attracting desirable birds other than nuisance birds. I also discovered that the dome is actually beneficial for keeping the feed protected from the elements and bird droppings. So I decided to continue using it.3. The dome does work better when I reassemble the feeder without using the spring. The dome wobbles much less and is more steady without the spring and therefore doesn&#39;t frighten the birds with that frantic wobbling.After all this tweaking I&#39;m still not satisfied with this Perky Pet feeder. I most definitely would not buy another. Nor would I ever recommend it. In fact, mine has gone in the trash.If you really want a squirrel proof wild bird feeder I highly recommend theBrome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic. Bromes are expensive but they are worth every penny. My Brome feeders paid for themselves in no time, just by what they save me in all the birdfeed that the squirrels cannot access.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great squirrel feeder; not-so-great bird feeder&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393891200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

I never realized how much better they could be until I tried ReLeaf Leaf Scoops. The other scoops that I used were round with jagged teeth on one edge, and they were kind of flat. They couldn&#39;t pick up large amounts of leaves or clippings at once, and small items fell out before making it to the bag, but they were still easier than just using my hands. ReLeaf Leaf Scoops are much larger, and they are cupped to hold a lot of material at once. The handles are easy to grip, and they are designed to help grasp my hands so they are easier to hold onto. I hold the inner handle, and the outer handle holds the back of my hands.  I tried them with and without gloves, and found that they feel better when I use gloves. They pick up everything from large leaves to fine mulch and hold it well until it reaches the target. I was offered a pair of scoops free for an unbiased review, and I&#39;m glad that I have so many good things to say about them. They really made my spring cleanup easier and I&#39;m sure they will work just as well this fall.

Mice will often make it to my outdoor shed, my garage and my basement. My shed has also been home to larger rodents.I have tried a number of traps and poisons to deal with the problem. It is hard to know how well a trap or poison is working at any given moment because I tend to get mice at certain times of the year like the colder months or when a family of mice have decided to live in my shed or garage. During a bad winter in New Jersey I went through a lot of mice poison and caught a number of mice. I have seen little activity this spring which has been mild. Different brands of mice poison seem to work better at different times.The Tomcat mouse killer bait stations are nice because they are covered and the poison comes included in the trap so I did not need to wear gloves while handling the poison myself. I used these in my basement.  The bait station is small. I have used larger bait stations. It looks like it is safe if children and pets are around because it is disposable so it would be hard to get into it. In the short time I have had this I have  seen  nibbles on two of the bait stations.This is great if you don&#39;t want to touch the poison and you have pets or children around that might try to open the bait station. Once the poison is gone this can be thrown out.

You need a big trap for a rat and that rat trap isn&#39;t heavy enough to trigger when a mouse steals the bait. If the rat hits the mouse trap they usually don&#39;t even slow down. With this live trap you catch whatever enters to steal the bait.I dispatch the caught animal buy placing the trap under water. After 30-45 seconds the critter is dead and the trap is ready to be reset.

If you have the ability to get a cord out to everywhere you want to cut grass, I think this is worth considering.  Larger lawns can also benefit if you want to avoid gas because you won&#39;t run out of juice when you have it plugged in versus running off of a battery.  It&#39;s not perfect, it&#39;s a little bulky compared to what I&#39;m used to, and the handle height isn&#39;t adjustable (on mine, even though the pictures on Amazon show it is) - so if it doesn&#39;t fit you, you&#39;re out of luck.  If you&#39;re still interested :), I have more details below.Living in the desert, I have a smaller lawn that is about 600 square feet (around 20 by 30 feet).  So, definitely not a huge lawn.  Even so, I&#39;ve put off buying a corded electric mower for years because I thought it would be a real hassle to deal with a power cord, and I thought the risk of slipping up and slicing the cord with the mowing blade were too high.  I always gravitated to wanting a battery-based model, but those have their own issues (heavier, can&#39;t mow if you forgot to charge the battery, batteries only last so long).  After growing up in Illinois and using a gas mower for many years, I just don&#39;t want one of those.  After reviewing the directions, I saw that B&amp;D; had a diagram showing the recommended mowing pattern to make it easier to keep the cord out of the way - and it worked great for me!  Probably common sense, but I was so used to the way that I&#39;d always mowed my lawn, it hadn&#39;t occurred to me to do it that way.  So, if you get one, check out the directions - it made using a cord a lot easier for me, and it alleviated a lot of the hassles that I had expected to encounter.There are a variety of mowers out there: gas, electric with cords, electric with batteries, and push reel.  I&#39;d like to compare this to a push reel because for fourteen years, I&#39;ve been using a reel mower much like thisAmerican Lawn Moweron Amazon.  Most reel mowers aren&#39;t fancy, but they can cost under $100, take up very little floor space, and work quite well if you don&#39;t let your grass get too long.  What mine doesn&#39;t do, but you can buy models that do, is catch the grass clippings.  What this B&amp;D; brings to the table versus my reel mower is a much more even cut, it catches the grass, and it handles long (higher than 6\&quot;) grass with ease.  The end result is a cleaner looking lawn.  The drawbacks are it takes a lot more floor space in my garage, it&#39;s heavier and bulkier so it&#39;s more difficult to carry around to my lawn (I don&#39;t wheel it because the rest of my yard is rock), and it takes longer to get started because I have to get the cord all set up and in place.In the end, I really like the more consistent cut and reduced mowing effort from this B&amp;D; versus my reel mower, but I might like even better the smaller footprint in my garage and reduced time it takes from start to finish with the reel mower.  So, for those of you with smaller lawns, I recommend that you at least consider a reel mower - but for those of you looking at corded mowers, I do recommend giving this model your consideration.  If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment and I&#39;ll respond as quickly as I can.Pros:(*) It&#39;s a Black &amp; Decker.  I&#39;ve purchased a number of their electric lawn care items (blower/vac, pole saw, chain saw), and I&#39;ve overall been happy with the build quality of them.  This mower is no exception(*) Handles long (at least six inches) grass with no problems(*) Very even and consistent cut(*) Super easy (and I mean super) change between cutting lengths.  I can&#39;t get over just how effortless it is to move the lever and adjust it.  I love it(*) Decently quiet.  Kind of like a hair dryer.  Louder than my reel mower, but by no means painfully or annoyingly loud(*) Safety bar on the handle will turn on blade if you let go of the handle(*) Fairly lightweight for a mower, given the extensive use of plastics(*) Has a built-in cord loop on the lower handle to store your extension cord right on the mower.  If you have a spare cord to use just with this mower, that is a very handy feature(*) Won&#39;t run out of power because it&#39;s cordedCons:(*) The vent holes all around the grass box let a lot of dust and dry clippings out.  The box does catch most of the grass, but it spits out a good deal of small particles(*) The handle on mine only had one set of holes, so the height is not adjustable.  It fits my height (5&#39;9\&quot;) okay, but I&#39;d like to be able to adjust it lower.  If you&#39;re shorter than me, this might be a problem(*) Takes up a lot more floor space in the garage than my upright reel mower, so finding a place for it was more difficult.  Not a con if you&#39;ve got plenty of room or are replacing another similarly-sized mower(*) It&#39;s always attached to a power cord.  Yep, that&#39;s both a pro and a con :)Notes:(*) It comes mostly assembled, which is nice, but getting it all together might take a little patience.  Putting the grass box together was a real pain for me.  The dark plastic halves aren&#39;t overly rigid, but you need to get a number of tabs lined up and snapped into place - which isn&#39;t easy when the halves are flexing and moving the tabs out of alignment.  One of my tabs was out of alignment, but I eventually got it massaged into place using a screwdriver.  It took much longer than I had expected.  Once done, though, it&#39;s easy to insert and remove the grass box from the main mower.  Also, one of the screws to get the handle attached took some doing to get it to catch the threads on the recessed hole&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Nice mower, and having a cord wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as I&#39;d feared&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402185600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

I am updating to remove one star. A few weeks after posting my review, I looked out the window to behold a huge squirrel comfortably perched on the grate of the feeder, chowing down on bird seed. When I went out to chase him off, he had a couple of moments of trouble escaping due to the dome, but then made a huge leap onto a faraway branch and scampered away. Squirrels are amazing acrobats, especially when there&#39;s good food to be had. This feeder will not deter them.Original Review:Some clever ideas have gone into the designing of this bird feeder, but in actual use the results aren&#39;t as good as I&#39;d hoped. Being able to raise and lower the dome according to the size of birds you want to attract seems like a great option. However, when I set the dome down low to accommodate small birds, the juncos and chickadees and song sparrows had a hard time figuring out how to get to the feeding platform without hitting the dome. Then, while they were feeding, they seemed nervous about the way the dome wobbles on its spring, like they thought it was going to hit them.I set the dome up higher and now the small birds like the feeder. The grate that sits over the seed to keep out squirrels is a good idea, and the little birds are comfortable hopping around on the grate to get their food. I&#39;ve noticed the ground-feeding birds like juncos especially like the dome because it makes them feel safe when they&#39;re under it.The problem I see with the feeder now is that the little birds with small beaks can only get food from under the grate when the feeding tray is completely full. Once the level of seed drops, the little birds have a hard time digging seed out from the spaces in the grate. I have watched chickadees hop around to various places on the grate trying to get a seed out, then finally get frustrated and fly to one of the other feeders in my yard where they don&#39;t have to work so hard.The feeder is easy to fill. I can just pour the seed in through the spaces in the grate. However, the feeder only holds half a pound of seed, so keeping the seed level high enough for short beaks to reach it requires some vigilance. So far I haven&#39;t seen any squirrels try to outsmart the design of this feeder, so I can&#39;t comment on that yet.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Updated Review. Great Squirrel Feeder.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394409600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 10, 2014&quot;}</td>

My other mower is a 13 year old Toro Recycler 22\&quot; deck with personal pace self-propelled drive.  I&#39;ve kept that gas engine purring and it&#39;s still running strong - Briggs and Stratton make a good engine.  But... it is loud (I mow with ear buds or plugs in) and it&#39;s considered not as \&quot;green\&quot; as some current options.  So even though I&#39;m a happy Toro gas mower owner... I thought I&#39;d give an electric a chance.A quick pros and cons for the start here...  remember that I&#39;ve only assembled and mowed once with it....+ Very light - this is a mower my 6 year old could handle (and no... I don&#39;t let her mow).+ packaged mostly assembled - only two Philips head screws to anchor the handle.  The rest is tool-less.+ Significantly quieter than my gas engine mower.  I don&#39;t have a SPL gauge, but I can mow without protection and wouldn&#39;t get a headache-  17\&quot; deck is a bit narrow.  It sure fits in the garage easy, but I&#39;m adding an additional swipe after every 3 passes to keep up with my 22\&quot; gas mower.  Will be a bit more exercise... and a lawn pattern with more wheel marks.-  Not self-propelled... perhaps this is an observation more than a Con...  It&#39;s light, so it doesn&#39;t feel like it needs a drive system-  Mostly plastic construction - long term durability?-  Wheels seem less rugged than ones designed for steel deck mowers.Now that we are past the bullets...  Assembly...well the handle attaches with two screws and the upper handle with two tool-less bolts with a hand side wingnuts... they all work well and provide a study feel when complete.The fancy plastic grass catcher comes in 4 pieces...  that&#39;s right... 4!  I spent more time inserting tab A into slot B than should be necessary.  The grass catcher is a work of functional art.  Two tone, with a compactor arm built into the unit.  It&#39;s a great concept in lawn tech.  I have some concerns over the long term strength over the 4 piece unit versus a molded one piece.  Time will tell if those tabs maintain their strength.  Some additional concerns are the weight.  The plastic catching unit is obviously heftier than a fabric catcher and when full and compacted with grass -- It&#39;s likely going to be a lot heavier than the motor deck.  The first spring mow was more of a top off cut than a normal full cut, so I didn&#39;t get to witness if the lack of weight in the mower deck and the ability to compact a lot of grass in this catcher turn into a big negative in keeping an even cut through less than ideal slightly bumpy terrain.From a grass catching perspective, it appeared to have less of a \&quot;suction\&quot; than my Toro gas unit.  It would go over leaves without pulling them up into the catcher,  perhaps this will improve when the height of the grass increases, but it&#39;s a noticeable different to the gas mower.  Mowing without the catcher in place is possible, but doesn&#39;t produce a mulching action when doing a light cut - I will check this again when the grass is higher for the next cut.The front edge of the mower has a molded handle built into the unit.  I&#39;m really not sure of why it&#39;s there - the top handle makes more sense.  But with garage space a premium, it looks a great place to use a hook and pulley to pull this mower up and hang it on the wall like my other electric yard tools...  unlike a gas engine; I don&#39;t have to worry about it spilling out oil or gas...The height of the mower is changed using a single handle adjustment behind the rear left wheel (its orange in the picture).  When the mower is raised and lowered, the cut gauge on the side reads out in inches...  I think it&#39;s great that it is simplified to not have to move each wheel to change height.  Much more user friendly.  My only concern with this method of raising the cut is that it is only raising the back end of the mower to achieve this height, putting the cutting blade at an angle.  This isn&#39;t as much of an issue on the grass in the middle of the cut, but the edge cuts won&#39;t be at the same even height due to the blade angle.  I don&#39;t yet have full enough grass to check the impact of raising it all the way up to 3\&quot;...  but I&#39;m interested in hearing others experiences with cut quality due to this function.The blade had a factory edge on it, which is normal for all mowers...  I&#39;ll be giving it a 90 degree sharp edge before the next mow...Handling... I&#39;m used to a heavy mower, doing a little bit of \&quot;Tokyo Drifting\&quot; with a self-propelled unit to slide into the end cuts and radius cuts.  The much lighter deck of this unit is definitely a different feel and seems easy to lift the mower off of its cut angle/depth.  I had to consciously change the way I&#39;m putting pressure on the handle to keep the deck down in walking turns.The balance of the mower feels a little off...  with very little weight in the electric engine and deck and the handle being attached over the rear wheels,  the additional weight of the catcher (especially when full) makes it unbalanced causing the front wheels to easily rise on a bumpy area...  This leads to an uneven cut.  Moving the handle attachment an inch or two forward of the rear wheels should make this tool feel more stable and cut more uniformly.And the biggest difference between gas and electric... the cord.  I&#39;ve used electric dethatchers and other devices in which you have to be cord conscious, so it didn&#39;t cause me too much issue.  But it is a significant consideration in how you mow versus a gas (cordless) mower.  Your mowing pattern has to be cord friendly... and your cord needs to be long enough to support your mowing swipes.  Cord management adds time to the mowing cycle, and even though it was out of the way most of the time, cords get caught up in my shrubs and plants, requiring adept lasso maneuvers to prevent walking to move a cord.Summary?  It&#39;s okay.  It may be durn perfect for a very small yard - but that&#39;s not my yard.  Even with a light early spring cut, it took enough time additional to the gas mower that it was noticeable - But that&#39;s really to be expected when you are dealing with a thinner deck 17\&quot; vs 22\&quot; and power cord management.  The jury is still out on the cut quality - I will add to the review as the grass thickens up.  But the height adjustment angled method is concerning me.  The unit is quieter and gives me green \&quot;street cred\&quot;  if you ignore the fact that Ohio power comes from burning coal...  I&#39;ll improve this review as I continue to use the unit this next month.  For now the Gas Toro mower is still hibernating.******Second mow this week at 3\&quot;...  The grass grew like the preferred weed that it is last week with all of the rain.  This time i added a 25&#39; extension cord to my 50&#39; cord to prevent unexpected loss of power from ripping it out of the socket.  That seemed to make my range much more acceptable in swipes across the yard.In the much thicker grass, the lack of a drive engine and the plasticy light nature of the unit made it more difficult to keep a nice clean line. I may just be used to the control of the Toro that makes this easier - I&#39;ll mark it off to my lack of skill , but my lines were not very pretty.  Although I could hear the engine audibly bogging a little with the grass cut, the cut seemed clean and the catcher was doing its job.  I could not visibly tell while standing if the cut was uneven due to the height mechanism angling the blade, but getting down to the level of the grass low on my knees, it was visible.  So this mower will not have a straight even cut at max height...  that being said, at that height, such unevenness is hard to detect -- which is the compromise the engineers took for the ease of height adjustment.  At the lower height settings, the blade lowers to level, making a low cut the most even it accomplishes..  when it is the most noticeable.After mowing with it for about an hour, doing the cable dance, and emptying the unit several times... I finally returned to my Toro recycler.  Checked its oil, added gas, primed... and on the first pull it started right up, as if 6 months of dormancy never happened..  I finished the yard faster with the gas mower.So why did I give up?  As I was concerned the B&amp;D; deck is too light.  When the heavy plastic grass catcher was just 3/4 full, it was so heavy that it could not even sit on its own four wheels due to being off balance.  It would fall back and rest on the grass catcher.  This lack of weight down on the front end of the mower leads to an uneven cut due to the front end bouncing, and me always pushing down the front to keep it cutting the grass.It&#39;s now hanging on the wall on my garage as a backup if my main mower has issues - but my recommendation is that this unit would only be best for those with very small yards and a willingness to deal with an evolving design that hasn&#39;t yet been perfected... to avoid having the maintenance and fuel requirements of a gas mower.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Initial Mow Review - Spring 2014&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398556800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 27, 2014&quot;}</td>

I&#39;ve always had the square type brushes for my grill in the past.  This one is a long handled brush that has the wires going all the way around the end.  The design is a bit different and at first I didn&#39;t quite understand the advantages.  When I got my brush, I went to the popular web video site and searched for alpha grillers brush and found an instructional video showing how to use it.  Wow!  I appreciated that information because I&#39;d been cleaning my grill wrong anyway.You get the grill hot, and you dip the brush in water, then scrub the grill along the direction of the grates.  Any brush will do this - but where this brush excels is if you get stuff down in the cross grates or in the corners.  Then this brush is easy to turn on it&#39;s side so you can use it with it&#39;s &#39;skinny profile&#39; and get down in between the grates.When you&#39;re done, you rinse it with hot water.  The strap is a flexible cord which fits on my Weber Genesis grill just fine - my old brush had a metal hook that would NOT fit at all.It&#39;s sturdy and long, and it has not bent or failed when I&#39;ve really mashed down and put a lot of weight into scrubbing.I really don&#39;t have any complaints or issues with it&#39;s form or function. It is more expensive than most grill brushes, but the bristles haven&#39;t bent at all after several uses, and it seems quite durable and very functional. I did appreciate the product instructional materials they provide very much.  They were very helpful to me personally in learning the right technique to use the product.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Works great, nice form and function&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403222400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 20, 2014&quot;}</td>

Snap traps, glue traps, spin traps, and several different types of bait stations. Of them all, this is perhaps the last I&#39;d choose (except maybe the glue traps... I hate to see animals suffer like that). While I&#39;m not a fan of poisons (I prefer snap traps), there are four different, very similar products, and it&#39;s hard to keep them straight:Mouse Killer: Disposable, kid and pet safe, and can be used both indoors and outdoors.Mouse Killer I(Best choice!): Refillable, kid and pet safe, and both indoors/outdoors.Mouse Killer II(this product): Disposable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoors only.Mouse Killer III: Refillable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoor only.Of the four, Mouse Killer I makes the most sense to me. It&#39;s as safe as they get, and refillable (and therefore more cost-effective in the long run). They all come with the same poison, so there&#39;s no difference there. That one has an additional covering over the entrance the others don&#39;t have, making it a little more tamper resistant, and a bit more attractive to mice, which like such things.The disadvantage of poisons? They don&#39;t work right away, and the rodents may go off and die in a place where you can&#39;t get to them, but their rotting corpses still stink up your house.My preferred option is still snap traps, which are infinitely reusable without purchasing additional products (poisons, etc), and much cheaper, especially when obtained at a local hardware store.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Not the one I&#39;d choose.

I LOVED that these cages broke down into small pieces, which made them MUCH easier to store, AND I loved that I could personalize how close-together the horizontal supports were.  They were fantastic for the first two seasons, but then fell apart.  Please read below.~~~~PROS~~~~~ Tall, Five-Foot Stakes-- the height of these cages means that I can bury the first six inches or so (for support/strength) and still have PLENTY of height for my tomatoes to grow with support.  Each cage comes with three stakes, each of which are steel stakes coated in a thick plastic coating.~ Sturdy Supports-- each cage comes with nine plastic support clips that can be placed anywhere on the cage that works for that plant.  For bushier tomatoes, I always put the clips closer together near the bottom of the cage, while for leggier tomatoes, I spread them out more.  The GOOD thing is that you can buy extra supports, so you can add as many as you would like.~ Easy-to-Store-- Because this cage breaks down completely, it is VERY easy to store for the winter.~~~~CONS~~~~~ Begins to Crack After One Season, and to Break After Only Two Seasons--  The plastic coating on each stake began to crack at the end of the first season, and by the end of the second season, the steel was VERY rusty and VERY fragile.  The ends had broken off of eight of my twelve stakes by the time I set them up for the third season, and most were in five or six pieces by the middle of season three.~ The Ends Bend Easily-- Despite being made of steel, the ends bend easily, which makes it hard to push these into hard soil.I would absolutely recommend these supports as long as you don&#39;t expect them to last season-after-season.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Fantastic for two seasons, but no more&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399161600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

Originally I bought permethrin-infused outdoor wear to ward off the mosquitoes, so I wouldn&#39;t have to slather my skin with DEET-based repellent every time I was outdoors.  More recently the Insect Shield clothing has become essential for combating the \&quot;quiet epidemic\&quot; of tick-borne Lyme disease here in New England.  After years of use, I can say unequivocally that permethrin-treated clothing is the absolute best solution for keeping insects at bay.  There have been times in the deep woods when I&#39;ve been swarmed by mosquitoes and flies -- they&#39;ll bite any exposed skin (hands, neck), but they never light on the treated fabric.  It&#39;s like a force field.  It works great.  And I&#39;ve never picked up ticks when wearing permethrin-coated clothes.The only downside, historically, is that I&#39;ve had to buy shirts and pants that were treated by the garment manufacturer.  It meant I couldn&#39;t wear my favorite gardening shirt or my favorite hiking pants.  That&#39;s where this product comes in.  I can use it to give my existing clothes an Insect Shield (R) like force field.  It&#39;s awesome.  A great solution for outdoor enthusiasts, especially those facing real health hazards from insect bites (where Lyme disease, malaria, and other serious diseases are rampant).  I&#39;m not thrilled about using any chemicals, but I&#39;d rather have the chemicals on my clothes than on my skin.With this can, I treated one complete set of outdoor clothes:  a pair of pants, a shirt, a pair of socks, and a pair of shoes.  I followed the instructions and sprayed each item until it was wet.  I probably could have sprayed a cap, too.As one other reviewer noted, the instructions on the can are unreadable by eyes of a certain age, even with reading glasses.  I know can real estate is limited, but seems like they could have figured out a more user-friendly solution.Bottom line:  Permethrin works, and it works great.  The only question is what&#39;s the best way to apply it.  The primary advantage of this aerosol can is that your finger won&#39;t get tired from pumping a trigger-sprayer bottle.  But having used both this aerosol can and the Sawyer trigger sprayer, I strongly prefer the trigger sprayer.  It gives me more control, is less messy, and seems to let me saturate the fabric better.  Both use the same ingredient; it&#39;s just a matter of which delivery mechanism works better for you. Unless you have arthritis that makes using a pump sprayer difficult, I&#39;d recommend the Sawyer 24 ounce trigger sprayer bottle for the most economical, easiest, least messy application.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Ingredient works great, but pump sprayer works better&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397520000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

Maybe I&#39;m slow to get with the program, but I previously wasn&#39;t aware these sort of leaf shredders existed. This electric leaf shredder from Sun Joe was well packaged and easy to set up and use. It&#39;s very loud! But it does a good job of making mulch out of the leaves. They are MUCH more useful to us in our garden than trash bags stuffed with dried leaves would ever be.We have four large trees in our yard and the clean up come autumn is always a handful. We can never keep up with it. But using this leaf shredder with all the leftover leaves in early winter was a dream. Here in Colorado, we&#39;re usually very dry with leaves that crunch under your feet. I&#39;m not sure and can&#39;t say what it&#39;d be like to use this leaf shredder with wet leaves. I used to live in Washington during college and the leaves never crunched, they were always soggy. I can say, if it works as well with wet leaves, then there is sure to be less dust than what we got.This shredder also packs away pretty nicely. Which is great since it&#39;s a once or twice a year type of thing. We&#39;re having a much better time shredding leaves, making mulch to use in our garden! If you&#39;re in the market for a leaf shredder, this one comes recommended by me.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I never even knew these existed...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390867200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 28, 2014&quot;}</td>

First off, the active ingredient is the same and in the same proportion in both products. The rest of what&#39;s in there is 99.9% &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;inert&amp;#34; ingredient. What that is, I don&#39;t know...but I&#39;d guess it&#39;s the same in both of them.Both products did equally well at getting my jasmine cuttings to root, and I didn&#39;t actually get my &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; cutting, the one without any rooting powder, to root. Probably someone with a greener thumb than me could coax it into action without the hormone, but why would they when this stuff is so inexpensive and lasts forever?Speaking of lasting forever, this container is 2 oz and the Bontone is 1.25 oz, and the Bontone tends to be more expensive...so this one is definitely the better deal, but it will probably take you years to realize those savings. The real savings are in not having to buy so many plants...buy one and propagate it!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;works as it&#39;s supposed to and a good value, too!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397347200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 13, 2014&quot;}</td>

This is my first time using a brush this style.  I normally use a brush with a scraper.I do like that the handle is long because once the water touches a hot grill, the steam is very hot.

It&#39;s flimsy plastic, so you get what you pay for.Pros:- Plastic is clear, so watching birds is easy- The roof does help keep the bird seed dry- The suction cups had plenty of holding power and held to the glass through most of the winter- The plastic cleaned up well with dish soap and water- The limited opening was an effective deterrent to squirrel raids.Cons:- The feeder consists of two halves of plastic that are held together by 5 little nibs along the seam.  Through normal use, these nibs broke and my feeder started to separate.  Luckily, super glue works well.- The opening is only big enough for a single bird, in my experience, without squabbles.- A single fall, if the suction cups give out, will likely result in a broken feederI think it&#39;s just o.k. because it is easily damaged and didn&#39;t permit more than one bird to feed at a time.  I ultimately upgrade to aSongbird Essentials Recycled Plastic Window Bird Feeder.  It&#39;s more accessible by squirrels, but allows several birds to feed at once without squabbles and is built far more ruggedly than a plastic window feeder.Tip:  To increase suction cup strength, clean the window well and put a minute amount of cooking oil on the suction cup.  It increases holding power significantly.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Won&#39;t Stand Up to Long Term Use&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404604800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

The Shake &amp;#8216;N&amp;#8217; Feed line is the easiest to use &amp;#8211; for established plants, just sprinkle it on top of the soil following the directions for proper amounts, and every time the granules get wet, the Miracle-Gro dissolves a little more and sends nutrients down to the roots.  Every couple of months, shake out a little more around the root-line of the plants.  The All-Purpose product works well for potted as well as ground plants.  With new plantings, I mix Miracle-Gro deep into the potting soil to give the plants a good start.  At first I was unsure but, once I got used to it, I found the newly designed shaker top is easier to manipulate than the old spout design.  With the spout, I sometimes poured more plant food than I intended.  I store my gardening supplies in an outside potting area, so I like that the granules of this particular food continue to be available in a water-proof container.  This ensures the bottom never gets soggy and turns the plant food into a block of unusable stuff.  It doesn&amp;#8217;t get any easier than this, and my plants thrive on it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Tried and True&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393113600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 23, 2014&quot;}</td>

I purchase big containers from a pest control company and use either small bait traps that were purchased on-line or bigger traps that are on a concrete block and purchased from the local branch of a national pest control company. Mice don&#39;t bother with the bait much during the summer, but like it in the other seasons. It has worked well for me in my country home. I have never had any problem with decaying mouse odors. I also use traps (I like JT Eaton 409BULK Jawz Plastic Mouse Trap, For Solid or Liquid Bait (Pack of 24) ). The combination works well for me. I never have had my dogs or any neighbor dogs show any interest in the bait, but something strong at night (raccoons?) have messed with them a few times.The refillable holders I have been using require a metal key to open.  I tend to misplace the key.  This has latch that you push to open.  It was a little tricky (maybe I should have read the instructions), but is easier than finding that key.  The top is clear.  I am not sure why it has the lip on the side as I can&#39;t think of anything I would hang it over.  Mice like to run along walls and that is where I put it.This is a tier 1 station, meaning it is made to be weather resistant and so can go outside.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Been using this sucessfully for years&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403049600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

It didn&#39;t draw blood so I got over the shock of it pretty quickly. We baited the traps with a combination of mouse attractant (which has worked for me before) and peanut butter. Ten days have gone by and we have not caught the mouse.In fairness, our other traps have not caught him either. I have live traps (mouse cubes) set up along walls in three rooms, a couple of plastic traps of a different model, and a couple of old-fashioned wooden traps.

This seemed like it would fit the bill, and for the most part, it did. It arrived held together with zip ties, with a plastic laminated instruction card entirely in French also zip tied to it. (Although this thing is made in Pennsylvania USA, I guess they only hoped to sell it north of the border or overseas, unless PA has a hotbed French gardening community I don&#39;t know about.) We cut the ties, purchased a box for it (NOTE: box sold separately), and hung it on the porch railing. The design is simple enough that the instructions were not needed, and you don&#39;t even really need any tools, as the plastic nuts can be secured by hand-tightening. (That said, getting a screwdriver and pliers to tighten it is not a bad idea.) The brackets slide from about two inches to four and a half inches, and with a little cleverness and possibly some better fasteners, I think it could be made even wider than that. (I did not test my theory, so no guarantees.) Once we got the plants in, everything looked great. The minimal design doesn&#39;t make any decorative statements. It just holds a box of flowers. It isn&#39;t the sturdiest flower box holder on the planet, either, but it didn&#39;t fall, bend, break or lose stability while we were getting it set up or for weeks after planting. This is just a basic looking, average flower box holder, but because it functioned well with no issues, I bumped the rating up to three and a half stars.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;How do you say \&quot;incredibly average\&quot; in French?&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403740800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

For right off the top I feel I must tell everyone, this is not a conventional flying insect killer.  It does not come out as a fine mist, and it is not designed for just clearing an area of hornets horning in on your BBQ, nor for any kind of indoor use.  It shoots a powerful jet stream of thick  white foam at least a good 15 feet, and easily more.  And it really is designed to be a nest killer.  The powerful stream keeping you from having to get too close to any nest, and perhaps taking one down that is up in a tree from a short ladder, or maybe just from the ground. That being said, this stuff worked pretty well for me. I had to first locate a nest, and that took a while.  I was finally successful when way in my back yard I found an old window box that had been taken over by a large nest of yellow jackets.  They were actively meandering around the nest when I discovered it, so I waited till very late at night before I soaked it.  The foam comes out thick and white, but quickly liquidates and penetrates.  I used about half the can, and then checked it the next morning.  Although a few bees still seemed to be hanging around, they neither went in nor even got at all close to the nest.  It otherwise seemed very dead. I felt comfortable enough to take the nest apart and found a few living larvae inside, but nothing as to adults. They were all either dead, or dying.  I sprayed again what was left and then threw it out...The effectiveness of this seems somewhat mixed here as to some of the other reviews.  But all I can tell you is that it was effective for me in destroying a large active nest, and they have not returned. It&#39;s very easy to use, and as noted, I only used half of a can on a nest that was buried in an old window box.  It could very well be that this foam is more effective for some species of bees than others.  And it could also be that some people are not using it at the best time.  Just remember whenever you have a real active nest to take out, hit it with the poison either very late at night, or very early in the morning before sunrise.  That&#39;s the only time that all the bees with be in the nest, and the only time you can be pretty sure to get them all.  I did just that and this foam worked very well.  It also comes at an excellent price here on Amazon, and I recommend it.. : )&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Effectively Killed Large Yellow Jacket Nest...Use Late At Night, Or Before Dawn..&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404345600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

It is a handy size for portability &amp; storage.  We bought the optional stand for it which makes it easier &amp; more comfortable to use.  You can cook 6 steaks with room to spare &amp; then pick up the grill &amp; store it away.  The only downside to the Q200 (Q2200)  compared to the bigger Q3200 is that it takes longer to get ripping hot because it has 1 burner vs. 2 burners on the Q3200.  That  makes a difference in preheating time, getting a good sear and maintaining high heat.  But the Q2200 does a really good job if you just adjust your cooking technique to accommodate the lower heating ability.  It also helps to use a 20 gallon propane tank with the smaller grills instead of those little camping LP bottles.  You will also need to purchase a hose &amp; regulator but it&#39;s worth it to improve the grilling capability.The Q3200 is quite a step up in grilling quality.  It has a lot more room, 2 burners &amp; attached cart.  We tried it in very cold winter weather &amp; it heated well (just took a bit longer to preheat), it seared well &amp; maintained heat.  It is impressive for a grill this size.  Our steaks were grilled perfectly with excellent caramelizing on the outside &amp; perfectly medium rare on the inside.It took us about 2 hours to unpack &amp; put this Q3200 together.  The directions are very good and easy to follow.  Give yourself plenty of room to spread out the parts and take your time.  It&#39;s not complicated.The LED light is actually a nice feature (I was skeptical).  You can turn it to \&quot;auto on\&quot; &amp; the light will go on as you lift the lid, shining light directly on the grilling grates.  As you close the lid, it turns off.  In the fall/winter we often grill when it&#39;s dark so this will get a lot of use.  You can also choose to have it off all the time for when you&#39;re grilling during the day.This Q3200 grill is not meant to be as portable like the smaller versions of the \&quot;Q\&quot;.  It is attached/bolted to the rolling cart (included) &amp; the 20 pound LP tank (not included) is stored/attached to the inside of the cart.  But, if you have a truck &amp; want to tailgate with a bunch of people, this would do the job.The porcelain-enameled, cast iron grates are very nice but I really wish Weber sold a stainless version.  I don&#39;t care how careful you are, the cast iron grates are going to flake &amp; rust (yuck).  We BABY our old Q200.  We store it in a heated room, oil the grates every time it gets used, do not use a steel brush or a brass brush, have never left it in the rain/weather &amp; STILL, the porcelain-coated grates started flaking after about 4 years of light use. If we had used a wire grill brush, I&#39;m sure it would have flaked much sooner.  We use a crumpled newspaper with tongs to gently/thoroughly clean our grates.  We don&#39;t want little broken brush wires on the grates &amp; then in our food (this happened with a good brass brush we had used on our charcoal grill).  Everything else on our old Q200 grill is perfect; even the stainless burners.  These porcelain-coated grates are the Achilles heel of the Q grills.Yes, you can replace with ANOTHER set of these same grates but you&#39;ll have the same problem; ceramic paint flakes on your food!  We have stainless grates for our big gas Weber &amp; our Weber charcoal kettle grills - they are the BEST.  You still get killer grill marks/searing without the concern of flaking grates.  And we have never had to replace them.PLEASE Weber, MANUFACTURE STAINLESS GRATES FOR THE Q LINE!*I emailed Weber &amp; was told the correct protective cover for the Q3200 is: Model #6553 Premium Cover**Update 4/2014:  I ordered &amp; received the \&quot;Model #6553 Premium Cover\&quot; &amp; it fits the Q3200 perfectly with the side tables folded down.**Update 5/28/2014:  I&#39;ve been using this grill for 4 months now &amp; really like it.

I never would have considered a sprayer (due to the cost) unless Amazon was sending it to me to test. But after using this Wagner sprayer, I&#39;m a convert. Using a sprayer is much faster and results in a more professional looking paint job that is smooth without brush/roller marks. Of course, there is a bit of a learning curve, so it&#39;s great that Wagner provides test boards so you can get used to the sprayer.Having a wide sprayer and detail sprayer, with their own canisters gives a lot of flexibility on the types of projects you can tackle with this thing. The wide sprayer works great with straight up paint, but the detail sprayer needs the paint to be thin down quite a bit in order to spray it. With both nozzles, you still need to mask the areas you don&#39;t want painted. Even though there isn&#39;t much overspray, you will get paint where you don&#39;t want it to be, specially little specks of it. The Wagner allows you to control how much paint is sprayed and the speed of the turbine for more precise control.My only issue is that it does feel a bit heavy and tired my arms frequently. But it&#39;s still amazing how much more wall I can paint in the same amount of time vs using a roller.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Never knew painting could be this nice&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389830400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

I have tried a wide variety of traps and poisons for moles, but not all of them have worked, but this one works if you leave it for couple of days. I usually leave it right next to the walls, on the outside of my garage. After three or four weeks, I have noticed that the poison has been consumed by the menacing rodent. This trap is safe and the bait station encloses the poisonous material inside (Bromethalin), and it is resistant to weather. It is preloaded and you don&#39;t have to handle the dangerous substance by hand. It is also kids and pet-proof.  It contains a tier of bait-station which is about an ounce of bar bait. This disposable bait station has a top which is clear translucent plastic. When the poison is consumed, you can see through the clear plastic, and usually the rodent dies in its dwelling. This can be safely disposed in the trash. Another plus is that this can be used either indoor or outdoor. This is a good alternative to glue-traps that immobilize the rodent and kills slowly and painfully. The good old-fashioned spring traps kill the pest instantly but are also dangerous to kids and the pets.

Both work about the same.  Light, fluffy, dry leaves work great; wet, sticky ones not so well.  Sticks break the line.The plastic on this feels a bit cheaper, but not by much.  It was a little easier to assemble, mainly because I had trouble getting the stand to fit in the holes on the Flowtron. Because the legs are independent on this, there were no issues with things lining up.I like that the legs are adjustable on the Sun Joe.  I had to jerry-rig a collection container (big plastic garden tub on top of a box) with the Flowtron.  With this, I can adjust the height to fit over the tub.  Attaching a bag with the bungee cords that both units have doesn&#39;t work as well as I would have hoped.  When the bags get half-full, they tend to pull out of the elastic.  I also tried putting the Flowtron over a garbage can lined with a heavy duty garbage bag, but when the bag was full it was impossible to lift it out of the can without tearing even the heaviest-weight bag.  Shredding over a bin (which needed to be close to the bottom of the shredder or the leaves went everywhere) and dumping the bin into a bag works best for me.The good thing about the Flowtron is that the whole unit pivots on the stand.  This made it easier to remove the filled bins or bags and also to change the line.  The angle on the line on this unit has the line hitting the bottom of the frame, which seems to wear it out quicker.  I also found the line easier to install on the Flowtron, possibly because of the greater flexibility of their line (I have only used the same brands as the shredder).This is much easier to store than the Flowtron.  The top half clips into the bottom, making it very easy to remove and nest together.  The legs can be unsnapped or shortened and the whole thing put on a shelf.  The Flowtron is best left fully assembled.Basically, I prefer the Flowtron, but if the price difference is big or storage is an issue, either one would work well.  Just realize that these are weed wackers on a base and keep your expectations in line with their abilities.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Comparison to Flowtron LE-900&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390176000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 20, 2014&quot;}</td>

I&#39;m not too keen on how the saucer connects to the bottom part of the container. If you don&#39;t put it together just right, the saucer will fall off when the weight of the water hits it. Other reviewers have stated that the waterer is empty over night. I have a feeling that&#39;s due to the issue I just mentioned; it&#39;s difficult to get it attached properly and I think the water just drains out. When I DO get it right, it works fine. Also due to its lightweight material, it will sway and empty more quickly on windy days.I like the capacity. I&#39;ve seen up to four birds (finches, wrens, black capped chickadees...smaller birds) sit and drink from it. I&#39;ve not seen anyone try to bathe in it yet:) ~ bought this specifically for my front yard. I have a feeder or two that I want to keep the birds at. However they tend to go to our back feeders, where our birdbath is located. I thought this would do the trick to keep some birds in front and some birds in back. It suits my purpose. All in all, it&#39;s okay, but I think they construction could have used a bit more thought/common sense, and I don&#39;t believe it would have increased the cost by much, if at all. I forgot to mention, it does clean up easily.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Flimsy construction, suits the purpose with minor issues...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400112000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

No, their last name is not Sawyer. So, I did enough to put this to the test before tiring and taking my machine home.I tried the various settings and there was some difference in the size of what came out. I was surprised by how much went through untouched on the coarsest setting. But, most was much smaller. This time of the year, the grass isn&#39;t tall enough to mow, so I couldn&#39;t test that shredder feature yet.Bottom line in use: it does chop up leaves. Comparatively, a line trimmer dipped into a trash can will do a similar job without the cost and storage of another item, but it is much messier. Yes, I have done that by fitting a plastic bag cover around the top of the trimmer and over the trash can. This machine is neater, quicker and easier, though.The assembly was very easy and the instructions were well written. The telescoping legs are a definite plus both in use and for storage. Extra lines are included. It will easily disassemble and store in it&#39;s original box. Since the height is infinitely adjustable, I&#39;m going to experiment with using it for an out feed surface for my table saw the rest of the year.Recommended for those who have a lot of leaves they want to compost or shred for mulch. The extra step to send leaves through this to just save trash bags when putting them to the curb for pickup probably isn&#39;t worth the effort or cost. So, judge it for your situation.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;It works for what it&#39;s intended for (and maybe more).&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389052800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

The rigid plastic sleeve at the faucet end to keep the hose from kinking at the faucet and the fact it is drinking water safe.  I did extensive hose searching last summer and found that any hose certified drinking water safe will be right around the price range Amazon is selling this one for. Because the hose has thick walls it is resistant to kinking but I have yet to run across a hose that absolutely will not kink.

Wang \&quot;jwangamazon\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [1, 1], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;I have some rental properties. When a property is vacant, I take careof the lawn. I have a corded mower, but I am tired of maintaining the cord.One time, I accidentally cut the cord while mowing. I have been thinking of getting a cordless mower, but that model has a heavy non-removable battery and the whole mower is way too heavy from transportation point of view.I am so happy to get this cordless mower with removable battery. I already have following 36-V cordless tools from B&amp;D;: cordless line trimmer, cordless blower, and cordless hedge trimmer. To my surprise, this cordless mower from B&amp;H; can take either 40V or 36V batteries. So, I have totally 5 batteries available for running this cordless mower.Majority of the construction material of this mower is thick plastic. With that, I would say the whole mower is a little on the flimsy side. However, that&#39;s good to me, as the mower is very light, not only from operation point of view, but also from transportation point of view. Even better yet, the whole handle bar can be easily collapsed down to take minimum space for both storage and transportation in my car.This mower is very quite, just like a fan running on high settings. The rear grass collecting bag is small but it is easy to remove and put back on. The light weight of this mower makes it easy to move around at tight corners.Some points need to be aware before choosing this cordless mower.One: each battery lasts about 15 minutes.Two: when a battery is fully drained, it usually is too hot to be charged. The charger will notify you on this and it won&#39;t start charging till the battery (inside) has cooled down. And each battery takes about one hour to be fully recharged. So, be expecting about 90-minute time for a fully drained battery to be available again.Three: It has limited power. When the grass is either too tall, or too dense, the motor will slow down. When the amount of grass is beyond its capability, the motor simply stops. Then, you have to release the button, wait for a minute and then re-start again. On the good side, it means there is no way you can burn the motor. On the negative side, it slows down your mowing work.All in all, as long as you are aware about the limitations of this cordless mower, I think it is a very good choice for properties with small lawns. I would definite recommend it to my friends.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Good choice only if you have a relative small lawn.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402963200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 17, 2014&quot;}</td>

I hate weeding, so using Preen is a no brainer.I wasn&#39;t so sure about this container with the power spreader cap, and figured it was a bit of a gimac.... but gave it a shot anyways. I&#39;m very pleasantly surprised. Normally I use a scoop to put Preen into one of those scotts handheld/crank spreaders and it&#39;s messy and yes, I often skip the spreader and just try to shake it from the scoop directly (which never goes very well). This container actually did distribute the Preen evenly and easily and since it&#39;s refillable (and holds enough product that you can do a good size area w/o having to refill it) I see myself using this every single time I need to reply now as well. I&#39;ll continue buying the large value sized containers, but will keep using this one instead of the crank spreader to put it out!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I love Preen and was surprised at how well the electric spreader cap worked!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400025600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 14, 2014&quot;}</td>

You are cautioned to avoid contact with skin as well as to wear protective eye covering when dispersing this product. If that&#39;s the case, I don&#39;t think I want it near my food, much less my children. So, we were very careful about where we placed it--on the patio between pavers, and in landscaped areas where the children don&#39;t play. Even had it not been for the children, this weed preventer is not supposed to be used on grass, which wasn&#39;t clear when we ordered it. Likewise, it does not eliminate existing weeds, just prevents new ones from growing. For me, that was the biggest issue with this product--to have as many warnings as it does, I&#39;d expect it to kill the weeds that already exist.The power spreader cap was actually not something that we found useful. The cap flips open, and the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; is in the flipped lid. Basically, the product is like pebbles that fall onto the cap and then are dispersed outward. You are supposed to control the flow by tilting the entire bottle up or down, just as you would if you didn&#39;t have the power cap. Perhaps it might be different when the bottle isn&#39;t near to full, but it&#39;s pretty difficult to control the output. And it&#39;s not easy to disperse to smaller areas. Effective or not, I can&#39;t see myself purchasing this product in the future.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Says it&#39;s safe for the veggie garden, but not safe on your skin...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399161600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

First off this is gas powered, and you have to mix a little of the oil that comes with it into your gas to make it work. My husband is you still on more so he figured that out quickly. Unfortunately you have to go to step to push this button in this many times in this that and the other and then pulling the cord just like a manual lawn mower, which takes a lot of strength.  Unfortunately for me with not much upper body strength, I could not do it, my husband had to do it for me.  When he had it running and handed it to me, I had to pull the trigger to hold the trigger you have to hold the handle the handle absorbs and operates with every bump and run off the engine. Ouch!This is only a good machine for somebody with you is very strong with lots of muscles.For those with arthritis ,I reccommend my favorite hedge trimmer the Black and Decker 20 Volt.Black &amp; Decker LST220 12-Inch 20-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless GrassHog Trimmer/Edger.  Check out my review of it on the last page.For a tall person OREGON Cordless ST275-A6 40-volt MAX Trimmer/Edger Kit with 4.0 Ah Battery Pac is ideal.Pros:gas powered no electric cord.  easy to assemble.  Revs up and is very powerful and cuts big weeds.  Oil is included.  Dual line (2 separate lines) for more cutting faster.  Bump end to make it feed down more line.Cons:have to mix oil and gas.  GAS IS FLAMABLE AND DANGEROUS, SO you can not store machine with the gas and oil in it. For storing you have to drain the tank.Complicated to start between pressing buttons and putting and levers in certain positions and then trying to pull the cord like a lawn mower cord several times to get it to go.Unfortunately the throttle button is located on the shaft of the trimmer and it vibrates every movement of the engine .  After only 5 minutes, I could not take it anymore and had to stop.  It made my hand literally hurt for an hour even with the use of aceptomyphen.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;extremely powerful gas hedge trimmer.  This does vibrate a lot, so not for those with arthritis.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397347200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 13, 2014&quot;}</td>

Seriously?  C&#39;mon.  So I had the opportunity to try out the GreenView spreader, which is battery powered (and to share my disclaimer, I was able to try the product for free, but I have zero incentive to provide anything but an honest review).I opened up the package, figured out how to slide the bottom part, and opened up the tab that sealed off the fertilizer.  Note that it does come with a full load, but you can easily refill the container.  I spent a minute or two trying to get it to work, and no luck.  Found out that one of the batteries was in crooked; once I fixed that, I was up and running!It is just plain fun AND easy to use this thing.  Just pull out the yellow tab on the bottom, and a little motor whirs to life, doing a very nice and even spread.  Just walk around and watch the fertilizer fly.  I was able to apply fertilizer to my lawn (average suburban size) in about 5 minutes.  This happens to be quicker than pulling out my giant green Scott&#39;s push-fertilizer (and much less messy).  And this product takes up less room than my old spreader; just sits on the garage shelf.  The battery life seems good.  It uses four plain old AA batteries, so in future years I&#39;ll just pop in some of my rechargeable batteries and will be good to go.The spread pattern was far more even than when my push spreader (or my small hand-cranked spreader) offers.  My old methods always seemed to have certain messy spots with too much fertilizer, and others without enough, but this makes the distribution quite even around the lawn.  The only very minor hiccup I encountered was when the spreader seemed to stop spreading, but I just had to give the handle one quick &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34; and the fertilizer flowed evenly after that.Bottom line, I figured I would be laughing at the product, but instead I will be laughing at the neighbors when I watch them making a mess with their giant push-spreaders.  Thanks for reading!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Seemed like a bit of a gimmick, but I love it!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401667200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

However, the poison is Bromethalin.  One dose is lethal to rodents, and they die within 24 to 36 hours.  The downside to this is that they may go elsewhere and die, which may be someplace that you do not want a decomposing creature.A persistent dog could chew on this, and it is deadly to dogs (and even more so to cats, but they are less likely to be randomly chewing on plastic, at least from what I have observed!).  There is no antidote, so if you have a rambunctious dog, you might want to consider a snap trap (annoying to a dog, but not lethal).Now, does it work?  In my experience, nope.  I placed these traps along with an electronic trap, and a couple of snap traps along the wall in my garage where I KNOW mice run (we catch about a half dozen a week).  After 10 days I pried the station open (which is not recommended) to be sure the bait had been gnawed.  It had not.I think I would rather go back to my old fashioned snap traps (at least I know where the dead mice are) or my new fangled electrocution chamber (which also kills instantly).&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Mice did not like, but if they do take bait they die elsewhere, which could be not a pleasant experience.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401667200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

It has textured rubbery pads and a screw mechanism to keep it firmly in place.  The knob on the curved clamp is quite easy to grip and turn;  sometimes these are a problem but this one is not.It uses three AAA batteries, which are included.  For replacements, I recommend good-quality rechargeable batteries like the Sanyo eneloop brand.  The battery compartment is held shut with a small screw.There are ten LEDS that produce a bright white light which is focused but in a pattern large enough to illuminate the work area.  It is easy to adjust the light to where it is needed and it stays put once adjusted.My only complaint is about the plastic clamshell&amp;mdash;I wish it were shipped in a cardboard box, frustration-free.Overall, a handy grill light that can be put to many other uses, as wellA review sample was provided by Kuisiware.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Handy clamp-on barbecue grill light&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401408000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

Few work effectively or for long, but this product contains DEET (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide). However, at 25% concentration, according to my research, it will probably not repel mosquitoes for the claimed 10 hours. According to a study by the Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association, &amp;#34;DEET formulations (20%-34%) offered 3&amp;#8211;6 hours of protection.&amp;#34; There is also some health questions about using DEET directly on the skin, especially on children (you should do your own research on these issues). I tend to use more natural substances directly on my skin (mainly a citronella oil mix) and limit the use of products such as this to only my clothing. Also, I tend not to wear dark clothing, which attracts mosquitoes more than lighter-colored clothing. It&#39;s also good to avoid wearing fragrances or using perfumed shampoo or soap before going outside.This product is great when used with care and realistic expectations. If you plan a long day out in the woods or at the time of year when mosquitoes are plentiful, carry this or other repellents with you to apply every few hours. Keep in mind that if you are sweating from work or play (sweat also attracts mosquitoes), you may need to apply this product more often.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The real deal&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400112000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

Don&#39;t ask why, just know it needed to be done, and I had a short time to get it done, as in hey this wall has to be history in two hours or less. It bit through everything that was in its path. Triple layer two by fours with nails (yeah I know), plaster (that was something), sheetrock, and some aluminum. It took some time but the task was finished , and no animals were harmed during completion of this project.I then on the same charge went on to chew down a tree as big around as a hub cap. That was ugly and I was a sweat ball covered in tree guts before it came down. The saw battery was spent. I was spent. The saw had used up all of the bar chain oil in the full reservoir, and came out of the day undamaged.I have also used it for more suitable limbs, branches, and a slew of treated 4 x 4 fence posts with impressive results.Needless to say always use eye protection and gloves, and I don&#39;t recommend abusing this fine saw like I did, just know that if forced to, you can and both you and saw will live through it.The only downside I found was that extra or replacement batteries are pretty pricey.Very Highly Recommended&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Used It For Bigger / Inappropriate Job Than It Was Built For&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397692800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 17, 2014&quot;}</td>

This has no bearing on the function of the stomper, just a heads-up for those who suffer from &#39;wrap rage&#39;.Once it was freed from the packaging the stomper is in two pieces that easily snap together. Put it on the ground, press the foot pedal, attach a broom handle - I had a broken one lying around - and it&#39;s ready to go.The first thing I noticed was the size of the foot. It&#39;s smaller than I expected and another couple of inches might make it even easier to compress the leaves.The product description states that it allows packing up to 4X more in a standard recycling bag - that may be true if you never attempted to pack down the leaves at all. I was already compressing the leaves so I saw no real change in volume but it does make the job much easier. Previously I would jump in the bag and stop the leaves with my feet. Probably not the safest thing to do once the bag gets over half full and begins to tip over with me trying to get out of it. I was happy to find a safe, alternative way to stomp that accomplished the same task.Overall, a nice little gadget to help with yard cleanup.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Nice little gadget to help with yard cleanup&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390867200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 28, 2014&quot;}</td>

Very inexpensive and has been working well for about  three weeks. We thoroughly enjoy watching it. When the sun is out. It is extremely sensitive to lack of sunshine ~ even on days where there are a few clouds in the sky ~ if the sun goes away, so does the fountain! I love that it came with several different fountain sprays. My favorite, is actually the shorter, standard type fountain fixture.I&#39;ve not had trouble with the water being expelled from the bird bath as others have. Even when using the taller fountain fixtures. I love that it keeps the birdbath water circulating ~ keeps it cleaner for a lot longer! Mosquitoes aren&#39;t quite here yet, but this should help keep them at bay.This particular pump has little rubber suctions cups that should stick to a bird bath that is GLAZED (maybe painted). My birdbath is concrete and it doesn&#39;t stick (I didn&#39;t expect it to). However, it sits nicely right in the center and doesn&#39;t move. The birdbath needs to be kept filled up so that the pump is submerged at all times or you&#39;ll risk burning it out.You need to keep that solar panel up high, facing as much of the sun as possible. I&#39;m fortunate enough to have a 6&#39; PVC fence and perch that panel up leaning on one of the fence post caps and it&#39;s perfect! The birds were a bit afraid of it at first, but not they really love it and I actually get birds bathing instead of just drinking, which is a treat for us:)For the price, I think anyone would enjoy this cute little fountain; just don&#39;t expect it to work well, or at all, without sunshine!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Submersible Water Pump (solar panel)&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400716800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 22, 2014&quot;}</td>

And where I live in Connecticut the deer-tick population is massive and those ticks carry Lyme disease (which I&#39;ve had, it&#39;s miserable--it settled in my knees) and so I fully understand why people turn to products like Cutter to protect themselves. And I *do* use it myself on rare occasion when I know that I&#39;m in a tick-infested area like a wet marsh or meadow. And yes, Cutter does work and probably as well as any other brand.I&#39;m giving it only three stars, however, because the chemical that makes this product work is DEET which is a much more dangerous chemical than manufacturers would lead us to believe. It must be used sparingly and should NEVER be used on babies or very young children. It&#39;s far better to cover up the skin that to bomb it with chemicals. Also, remember that there are many natural insect repellants (look them up online, there is a lot written about them) and I grow several scented geranium plants in my container garden every summer to use for repelling mosquitos. Lemon-scented geranium is very simple to grow in a pot and breaking off a few leaves and rubbing them on your skin works very well. Also, you can still buy \&quot;punks\&quot; in some stores and online and if you&#39;re just sitting in the yard or in a park/beach, burning a few inexpensive punks will give all the protection you need.So, am I just being paranoid or is DEET actually dangerous? Well, here is what the EPA says on their site:Read and follow all directions and precautions on this product label.Do not apply over cuts, wounds, or irritated skin.Do not apply to hands or near eyes and mouth of young children.Do not allow young children to apply this product.Use just enough repellent to cover exposed skin and/or clothing.Do not use under clothing.Avoid over-application of this product.After returning indoors, wash treated skin with soap and water.Wash treated clothing before wearing it again.Use of this product may cause skin reactions in rare cases. The following additional statements will appear on the labels of all aerosol and pump spray formulation labels:Do not spray in enclosed areas.To apply to face, spray on hands first and then rub on face. Do not spray directly onto face.My suggestion with products like Cutter is to spray it on your clothing and not on your skin. Tie a kerchief around your neck and spray that and it will protect your face quite a bit.I&#39;m not trying to trash Cutter here, by the way. I gave the three stars because the product does indeed work quite well. But it would be irresponsible of me to say, sure, slather this on, without acknowledging that there are dangers. I have downgraded it two stars because I think these companies should acknowledge the dangers more--particularly for babies and children. But if you use it sparingly when you are in infested areas and if you wash up afterwards, it&#39;s probably an acceptable risk for adults. Lyme disease and West Nile are terrible things and I would have to say the risk of DEET dangers is probably low by comparison--but that does not make it 100% safe. Do some online research and draw your own conclusions. I will carry this Cutters with me (I like the dry-spray, by the way, that&#39;s not just hype, it&#39;s far less oily) and, when the situation is desperate, I will apply it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;You must know the dangers of DEET before you use this product&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398988800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

Perfect mosquito weather, one would think.  I used this product, and am happy to report that I did not get one single bug or mosquito bite.

From what I can see online, mosquito season doesn&#39;t usually get rolling in Oregon until June.So, unfortunately, an element of doubt must accompany my positive review.

I chose a park near me. Opening the cover for me was not easy and I was not comfortable letting a live mouse out a foot away from me while I held the trap.The instructions say to check to check this twice daily since mice can get dehydrated and to release the mice immediately if you catch more than once since they are territorial. You need to watch this trap.If someone is comfortable around mice and does not want to kill them I think will work fine. Yet you need to watch the trap since you don&amp;#8217;t want territorial mouse hurting each other.Relocation would seem to be an issue though since I would think the reason a person would catch  mice is because he or she does not want them in his or her home. If a person lived near a park or woods that may get the mice far enough away so they don&amp;#8217;t come back but if a person lives in a suburban or urban area it seems to me you are just giving someone else a mouse problem&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;It Works But Requires Checking At Least Twice a Day&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403654400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 25, 2014&quot;}</td>

It worked well.The pole holding it gave out (wet soil from heavy rain and snow), and the feeder hit the ground (frozen grass). It literally smashed into about 10 pieces; I don&#39;t know if I even found them all.The interesting part of this story is that the thistle feeder hanging on the opposite hook of the pole and 2 poly rain rings (over the tops)  did NOT break. Only this feeder broke!! I suspect that it was either weather-worn, OR an old(ER) feeder with limited life to the plastic, OR that it was made of poor cheap material originally.A few feet away, I also had a large barn-type feeder on a pole which was not effected (anchored in cement), i.e., NOT attacked by an animal which the company seemed to want to blame: an animal attack.I wrote MANY times to the mfg for replacement.FINALLY, they said that an animal probably got at it, but they couldn&#39;t guess which one. DUH. I said that the other pieces which fell did NOT break, AND that the other barn style feeder, only a few feet away, was not touched, basically ruling out an animal attack in my simple assessment.Last email from mfgr: Their policy was that they could NOT replace the entire feeder!?I asked about the lifetime warrantee again.They asked for photos. I sent them.Then they asked what pieces were intact and which were broken.I wrote that they&#39;d just have to look at the pix because I had never taken the feeder apart and could not say.Answer: NO REPLACEMENT; must have been an animal attack (their words).BOTTOM LINE: Forget the lifetime support. They won&#39;t replace the feeder.Be ware of expecting any type of replacement or support from the company. The emails were almost accusative; really off-putting, as if to discourage further contact. And I had shown them a photo of the pole AND the other elements on it which did not break. We exchanged probably half a dozen emails.I&#39;d like this feeder again, but I&#39;ll be d....d if I spend money on something which is NOT supported when the mfgr says that it is supported for a lifetime replacement.Whose lifetime? An ant&#39;s?Probably made of SHODDY MATERIAL with a limited life is my conclusion.The company will insist that \&quot;some\&quot; animal attacked it, and they don&#39;t support animal attacks.

I knew a gas trimmer would be way too heavy and bulky for me.Because my old trimmer was a black and decker, I was able to use the same string spools.  On one hand this was great, because I had 4 new spools.  On the other hand, I was hoping this trimmer would use thicker string.  I have chain link fence around the majority of my yard, and I would normally go through 3 spools of string each time I used the electric trimmer.  I assumed it would be the same with this Black and Decker LST420 trimmer.  Not the case.  I don&#39;t understand it.  Maybe it&#39;s because it rotates faster and is more efficient.  I don&#39;t know.  Whatever the reason, I am extremely happy about it.For my purposes, I am not a fan of the edging/wheel.  A lot of my sidewalk areas are higher than the yard level.  I found in these areas, the edger didn&#39;t work well.  On part of my driveway where they are the same level, it worked fine.  I also had trouble getting close to an area at the base of my porch, because the wheel seemed to hinder the reach of the string.I am very happy with this trimmer, and it is such a relief not to drag around that cumbersome mega-long extension cord (about 100&#39; cord).&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Now I don&#39;t hate trimming nearly as much&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403049600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

You can easily adjust the speed to match your preferred gate and it pulls itself along nicely even when going uphill. I also like the ability to fold the handle and store the mower in a vertical position. It was very easy to set up and required almost no assembly.  It is far more heavier that the units without self drive so if the drive unit fails its not feasible to push by hand. It takes some getting used to navigating it in tight spaces.

I can now turn the faucet on, set a timer, and come back in 20-40 mins (depending on the recent weather)....and my plants are all watered! I like that this is flat, so it&#39;s easy to place it. I ordered the little stakes, too, and think they will come in handy--because sometimes, when you&#39;re working in the garden or re-mulching or whatever, the hose can get moved. Might as well secure it.This hose is super easy to weave around plants. I put it pretty close to them so that they get enough water. Experiment with the water pressure--I find that it&#39;s best to barely turn it on and let them have a nice long, slow soak.This will definitely make my life easier, save water, and prevent me from doing what I always do--just giving the plants a quick, shallow soak, which is exactly what you&#39;re NOT supposed to do!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Perfect for smallish flower beds&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401926400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 5, 2014&quot;}</td>

I compared this product to my TORO handheld electric blower/mulcher with chrome impellar and a Craftsman gasoline chipper, mainly ued for branches and incidentally leaves.Packaging is pretty good and everything arrived undamaged.  It was pretty easy to assemble; I did not even need to use instructions!  The legs are made from aluminum and are height adjustable (with measurement markings).  Even if you are fairly short or tall, you should be able to set the height to your liking.  The rest of it is made from sturdy plastic.  The motor is quite strong and since it&#39;s electric will require barely any maintenance.  The cutting mechanism is merely heavy guage weed wacker string.For dry leaves and thick twigs, I thought this shredder worked fairly well.  I mounted it inside my garbage can, since I didn&#39;t have any wide mouth bags that would fit (and it doesn&#39;t come with one...)  Ear protection and eye protection are a must as this thing gets very loud and the top is fairly open and could potentiall throw twigs out.  After the first couple handful of leaves, the fine dust coats the hopper and makes most of the leaves slide into the shredder easily.  Sometimes, I used long twigs to help it along.  I confess, it was tempting to use my hands to mush the leaves in, but if you look into the mouth of the shredder, you realize it will take your fingers off and mangle your hand, in less than a second.  I fed this machine a mix of dry pear leaves, pine needles, and twigs of varying sizes.  What I got was some nice mulch quickly which I then dumped promptly into my garden bed. I also got a runny nose from all the fine dust, so if you have a surgical mask, I recommend you wear that too.  The legs pop off easily and I store all the pieces inside one of those very large black plastic disposable planters.For comparison, the SunJoe is is farily well built compared to the other two tools I mentioned above.  You have to have a lot of patience with the TORO if you are going to mulch a large pile of leaves with it since the vacuum intake is a bit smaller and long twigs jam it up pretty easily.  The Craftman is like bringing a bulldozer to a garden bed if all you want to do it mulch leaves and twigs.  As a one-task machine, the SunJoe works quite well.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Perfect size leaf bits&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389657600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 14, 2014&quot;}</td>

If and until this type of hose becomes common, amaze your neighbors and scare children as this thing expands like some deadly snake awakening from slumber and then retracts in jerky, life-like spasms.Pros:-REALLY light and compact. almost looks like a limp ribbon hanging under the faucet. You could stuff it in a little flower pot. There is no tedious winding or tangling: that is huge for me.-Solid metal ends. Apparently they are brass; They are not flimsy stamped metal. Also, the end has a built-in ball valve; you almost do not need to add a nozzle because small adjustments of the lever let the stream evolve from shower to jet.-Handles our 70 lb. water pressure just fine, although I find the stream more like what comes out of a half inch hose than a 5/8th.-So far does not seem to tangle or kink.Cons:-You can&#39;t just turn on the water and use it. You must allow it to fill slowly. It is fun to watch but takes well a minute.-According to instructions, you mustn&#39;t store it in direct sunlight. How long before this thing deteriorates?-You must also let it drain. Don&#39;t keep it under pressure; but this happens quicker than \&quot;inflating\&quot;.-If this thing leaks or you damage the female end, there is no repairing it like a conventional hose, so take care.I Will update if there are durability issues, but so far, this is my new hose.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Usable hose, or just a good party trick?

They are sturdy for grilling big slabs of ribs and hold the whole chicken breast, chop or steak for easy turning. They are made of heavy duty stainless steel so they will last a long time. Nice locking feature, just slides in and out. My other tongs had an extra piece that had to slide over the handle. Clean up is easy and they can hang from a hook so they are handy while grilling. The price is reasonable and you won&#39;t need any other tongs, however I will probably purchase another one as we grill different meats at the same time and it is important to keep tools separate.I was given these tongs to try out and give my honest opinion and was not compensated in any way.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great Long-Handle Grilling Tongs by Mr. Grill&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1405123200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 12, 2014&quot;}</td>

And that&#39;s pretty much what this product is: 85-95% peat (my bag is probably on the high end of that range).  There is also a little perlite, a *very small* amount of chemical fertilizers (.03-.03-.03), and wetting agents to make the peat absorb water easier.  For the people who complained about lots of sticks it&#39;s probably coming from the peat - if you buy a bag of peat you generally get a lot of naturally occurring debris.Still, it worked pretty well for me.  The fertilizers are light enough to give a small boost to seedlings without burning them.  I think I might have preferred that it have worm castings added, but that&#39;s just my preference.  The peat still took a while to absorb water so the wetting agents are pretty light as well, but it was definitely easier and quicker than plain peat.  And being so heavy on peat, it didn&#39;t dry out quickly.  Overall, a nice product for seed-starting or cuttings.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Peat with a little perlite and some NPK&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396915200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

Next, press one of the (included) yellow coin-like inserts into each of the red flower-shaped medallions.  The (included) perches will need to be screwed into the underside of the base with a flathead screwdriver (not included). One will find 3 pre-drilled holes, one for each of the perches. When finished, there will be a perch above each of the flower-shaped medallions for the little Hummers to rest on while sipping nectar. Done!The unit is made of a very sturdy, thick, plastic. Cleaning the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, for the first time, was quick and easy. A normal sized bottle brush did the job.The nectar reservoir is crystal clear, making it easy to see the nectar level from a distance. The opening is large, making for easy filling or cleaning.  The large base, with six feeding ports, easily screws on, or off, the feeding reservoir for refills or cleaning. One fills the reservoir when the unit is upside down, screws on the base and flips unit right side up, then hangs in designated place via a sturdy metal hanger built into the cap. The red cap -- at the top of the unit -- also screws off, providing a flat surface for filling the unit. Nice!Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master Hummingbird Feeder has a 48 ounce nectar capacity --  that&#39;s 6 whole (8 ounce) cups of nectar. This will make the feeder a bit heavy, so one will need to select a sturdy hook, or tree branch, to hang it from. The large size, and weight (when filled with nectar), of the Hummingbird feeder, keeps the wind from blowing it back and forth. It is also large enough to be seen from a distance, making it a very nice focal point in the garden or on the patio. There is no ant trap/moat on this Feeder....Neighbor-envy... The Hummers flock to my new Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder ..  *smiles, sips espresso*tip:  this is the nectar recipe I&#39;ve used for years:  add 1/4 cup of pure cane sugar to 1 cup boiling water -- stir till clear -- let cool -- add to Hummingbird feeder. Change out once a week...Does the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2014&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;...Neighbor-envy! :)&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398297600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 24, 2014&quot;}</td>

Two were regular axes, the fiberglass handle on the one split and frayed, the head on the other came off and was not repairable. Regular axes have their place, but if you&#39;re splitting all day long they are NOT what you want.I had an old school wooden splitting maul axe I got from a buddy that I used for about two seasons, and I thought it was the best thing ever. However it weighed over 12lbs. A great muscle builder, but not quite as fun when you get older. I came across a similar splitting maul at Lowes, TrueTemper. It was great that it only weighed 7lbs, and I found I could split more in a day with it using faster swings. After 4 seasons with that, constant resharpening, I came across the hardest Oak I&#39;ve ever seen. I was really struggling with the TrueTemper, finding myself constantly having to take double swings to get through a piece (sometimes more). It was embarrassing almost, until I had a party one night and 4 different guys tried the axe on this tree and all failed equally. It was perfectly sharp and at the proper angle, I just couldn&#39;t easily get through the wood..Then I found this.. I instantly found myself just TEARING through the wood, like it was nothing. I honestly couldn&#39;t believe it. This axe is 6.25lbs, about 3/4lb lighter then the TrueTemper. So I could more easily, and with slightly more speed swing it. I think the key to it&#39;s victors is the angle of the blade and the maul/wedge. The blade edge (long ways) angles back towards the handle so when you strike the wood you don&#39;t have to compensate for the axe to hit it at the perfect angle (although depending on the wood height you still need to hit it right). Then the wedge is a much lesser degree of incline then the Lowes, that the maul has a chance of getting into the wood and pushing through before the maul starts splitting it apart. The Lowes one had a much steeper angle towards the edge of the blade, so it on really hard wood it was getting stuck there as soon as the blade touched the wood.There&#39;s honestly no other splitting maul options in my mind. I could never recommend anything other then this, because it is simply the best in all splitting situations. Other good points on it is :-corrosion resistant head steel (although please don&#39;t leave it outside, it will dual the edge)-hollowed out handle thats even more lightweight, but EXTREMELY strong-lifetime limited warranty-strong head through handle design, looks much more durable then your standard axe or maul-head cover to protect the blade and anyone/thing that might come in contact with it.I also recommend getting theFiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpenerand hitting it frequently. I usually don&#39;t go more then a 1/4 of a cord without sharpening, sometimes an 1/8th. It definitely makes it a lot more easier to split - especially for hard or wet wood.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The best splitting axe, hands-down.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393632000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

The feeder gets a lot of clinging bird action, much more than other wired feeders in our yard.  The birds seem to prefer the fly-through openings, and they have no problems pulling out sunflower seed through the wires.  Squirrels extract seeds too, but with difficulty.  They can wriggle through two circular holes at once, with a tail poking out one end and a head sticking out the other.  While that&#39;s comical to watch, it&#39;s not fun seeing determined squirrels try to bend and break the wire mesh.  The feeder is now off-limits to them.I like the easy-fill cap, all-metal construction, and the fact birds can land anywhere to get a seed.  It does create somewhat of a mess on the ground, but that goes with the territory of bird feeding.  I never tire watching birds at this feeder, especially during wintertime when activity is high.UPDATE:  While the second feeder I just received resembles the first feeder in looks, it is apparent Perky-Pet has cut some corners.  The wire construction (particularly where connecting with the metal framework) is shoddy workmanship.  I can easily push the interior wires in (leaving an open gap).  They used to be solidly connected (soldered) to the metal square and circle framework.  Just imagine what a pesky squirrel could do with those wires now.  The wire itself is no longer coated either, so I wonder how long it will take before rusting begins.  The easy fill cap design has also changed for the worse.  My original feeder&#39;s roof clamped down on the body so no thieving varmints could pry it off.  This new one has one of those awful buttons that supposedly locks the roof in place, but every feeder I&#39;ve used that has one operates poorly.I&#39;m disappointed Perky-Pet took a good product and turned it into junk.  Even though my first feeder is a little beat up, I have the feeling it will outlast the second one I just received.  Five stars for an entertaining feeder that birds actively like and use, but two stars for inferior quality.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Popular With The Birds But Perky-Pet Continues To Cut Corners&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393200000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 24, 2014&quot;}</td>

Chou \&quot;THE Savvy Consumer\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;After I&#39;ve cleared the drybrush and trees from the slope behind my backyard, a gopher infestation exploded in my lawns.  Never to be outsmarted by rodents, I tried a wide variety of anti-gopher weaponry, including this Yard Butler Mole/Gopher Bait Applicator.Likes:*Sturdy metal spike applicator with a t-bar handle and foam grips.*Fairly easy to use: place bait/poison in the top container, insert the spike tip into the gopher hole, and turn the dispenser handle on top to dispense the gopher tidbits (available separately).Results after two weeks:*I don&#39;t know whether the gophers were immune to the bait, or the poison actually worked and some other predators dug up their decaying carcasses, but I ended up with newly dug holes around the baited areas along with a good sized mini &amp;#34;pitcher&#39;s mound&amp;#34;.Conclusion:Gopher bait/poison did not work for me.  It only aggravated more gophers to dig more holes.  The only dead gopher was one that drowned in my pool, but that was weeks after applying the bait.  Now I&#39;m also concerned about poisoning predators such as hawks, coyotes, possums, and skunks, that are important in the food chain.  I&#39;m not using any more gopher bait/poison, but this applicator is very handy as a probe for locating gopher tunnels and implementing other weapons of rodent destruction.  If all else fails, time to call the pros.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Good gopher bait applicator but results may vary.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400544000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 20, 2014&quot;}</td>

Be very careful when handling the trap with the rat in it. Traps in general are hit or miss and this one is no exception.Also, beware that using peanut butter or cheese will attract pets. Place the trap in a place where the pet can&#39;t get to it.Warn children not to go anywhere near it as well -- you don&#39;t want the child getting his or her fingers snapped off or handling a dead rat, or worse, getting bitten by a trapped rat.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;watch your fingers, pets, children; use an alternative if you can&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404604800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

The spray didn&#39;t damage the burgundy trim painton garage, the factory paint on garage door, nor harm the grass.The foam is water based so it can be washed away from unwanted areas/over-spray.However - the can states a number of warnings.Don&#39;t allow adults, children nor pets in area till spray has dried.Don&#39;t get spray on desirable plants.

The combination provides an immediate boost, plus a long tail.Application &amp;#8211; The package says that a single application lasts up to three months.  Because many of the trace minerals are water soluble and not in a time-release form , I prefer to use the recommended amount for the first spring feeding, and then feed roughly 2/3 of the recommended  amount every two months thereafter.  This 4-1/2 pound package will feed roughly 135 sq. ft. if you&amp;#8217;re using it in a vegetable garden or flower bed.  For outdoor pots use 1 tbsp. for an 8&amp;#8221; pot; 1.5 tbsp. for 10&amp;#8221;; 3 tbsp. for 12&amp;#8221; and 5 tbsp. for 14&amp;#8221; pots.

I have found with previous fire pits if you keep it up off the ground a few inches and keep it covered they will last much longer.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Fire me up!!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402531200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 12, 2014&quot;}</td>

I honestly have to wonder if anyone at the company actually *tried* this bird waterer before they tried to sell them. My guess is they bought them wholesale from China sight unseen and then tried to market them: bad idea.The idea is brilliant: a bird waterer that can refill itself on rainy days, or that can be easily filled from the top using a garden hose or whatever. Great idea!The problem is that this thing simply doesn&#39;t hold water--even when it&#39;s perfectly level. I tested it in my kitchen sink and filled it with water and left it on bottom of the sink and came back a while later (like a half hour) and it was completely empty. So I tried it again, and I put it in a bucket with a perfectly level bottom to make sure I was giving it a fair test and (insert buzzer noise here), another fail!I&#39;ve been trying to think of someway to re-engineer this so I can find a use for it, but so far nothing.Who in their right mind would sell a product that didn&#39;t work at all? If you want to give the birds a drink (great idea!) do yourself a favor: buy a nice birdbath or a little garden fountain (birds like running water, so the latter is probably a better idea).As far as this goes: Next!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;It simply doesn&#39;t hold water--a great idea that fails miserably&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399507200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

Since I just starting using this one, time will tell how long it holds up.  I am impressed with it so far.  Easy to start and easy to use, it&#39;s a powerful trimmer that has done a great job for me so far on some tough yard areas.  I do notice quite a bit of vibration during use, but that&#39;s minor.It does accept attachments, which is a plus for me.  It&#39;s lightweight and well balanced, and started on the second try.

When I was offered a review sample I did not have grilling in mind. The clamp looked like it would fit a microphone stand and that is what inspired me to undertake a review.When I first received it I could not believe that the on/off marking on the top of the lamp was a real switch. It looked as though it was painted on the casing, but someone forgot the switch. After loading it with batteries a mere touch of the marking switches the light on and off. It&#39;s pretty clever actually and one of the reasons why I gave it five stars.The battery compartment requires a small Phillips head screwdriver to access the compartment. It&#39;s a pain, but it has a purpose: it keeps the compartment waterproof. I tested that by actually submerging the light in a sink basin filled with water. It remained lit and was no worse from my experiment after I removed it and dried it off. So if you do use this for outdoors grilling and forget to bring it back in, it will probably survive the elements for months.I use mine as a handy flashlight that I can conveniently affix to a mic stand. When I need to illuminate a section of a dimly lit stage, a few turns on the clamp screw releases it and I can use it as a conventional flashlight. It is actually strong enough to be a close-in work light for minor repairs in the dark. In fact, it has a lot of uses far beyond what it was designed to do.Normally I donate review samples after I evaluate them, but this one is a keeper.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Bright lights; big city&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402444800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 11, 2014&quot;}</td>

But the ingredient Sporex(R), which they claim is a unique additive which removes the toughest stains from mold, mildew, algae, dirt, grease, oil, sap, oxidation and more, may help remove the &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; but not the mold, mildew and algae.  You still need to use bleach.  In fact I use the bleach first to kill the mold, mildew and algae in my ACE plastic sprayer which is designed for bleach mix.  After you let that sit for 15 minutes or so you get your pressure washer powered up with Krud Kutter siphoned into the pressure washer stream.  You begin by a low pressure settling to apply the Krud Kutter and let it sit for again about 15 minutes.  Then you go crazy with higher pressure settings (absent the siphon of Krud Kutter).  Doing this method you will have a very clean exterior surface.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Still need bleach&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399248000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 5, 2014&quot;}</td>

The carry handle locks when not being used to pump up the sprayer bottle.+ This sprayer will spray right down to the last drop in the bottle!The cons:- If the sprayer is opened while under pressure, the contents can blow back into your face.  Most people will only do this once! :)- The markings on the side of the tank are difficult to see.  I used a permanent marker to highlight the raised markings.Closing thoughts:&amp;#9642; This is a VERY good sprayer for what it costs!  I ran 3 gallons of Roundup thru it today with zero problems.

The quick connectors work very well for getting the unit set up fast and there is a range of wands for different applications (including a scrubbing kit which I&#39;d not seen before). The unit looks more or less identical to the old one, containing a holster for the spray and a holder for coiling the cable.In terms of pressure, it&#39;s extremely powerful, second only to the much more expensive gasoline washers and better than the previous Karcher. To compare both machines, on a dirty driveway I would have to hold the wand of the old machine only an inch from the ground to create enough pressure to remove stains and ground-in dirt. On this model you can comfortably use a 4-5 inch spread to achieve the same effect which makes the job much, much faster. At a 1-inch distance the new machine will remove almost anything at all.It&#39;s a great machine in its simplicity and power and has reduced my six-monthly pressure washing tasks from 2 hours down to about 30 minutes. It feels like a solid, commercial unit and is definitely the most powerful electric washer I&#39;ve used.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The best electric pressure washer I&#39;ve used&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396569600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

This has taken our camping trips to a whole new level of convenience.The solar panel is shockingly high quality. We can charge our cell phones without running our vehicle and using a power inverter.The lights work better than the best camping lanterns we have purchased in the past. They charge fairly quickly from the solar panel and last the staggeringly long time that is advertised. The batteries appear to hold the charge well over an extended period of time.We use the small orb lights to hang in the tent or around the campsite, and carry the lantern with us. Be prepared to be mocked by your fellow campers, as it looks a bit like a giant sippy cup.The electronic portions of this are every bit the high end setup they should be at this pricepoint. I am very impressed and can imagine using this in other scenarios, such as small buildings without power.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Luxury Tent Camping&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403136000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 19, 2014&quot;}</td>

According to their website, the area can be reseeded or replanted in about 2 weeks - longer than I would have liked, but within an acceptable range.

The best way to do that is to use a digital thermometer. This model this model is lightweight and comes with a plastic sheath with pen clip. The packaging says that the measuring range of this thermometer is -58F-572F.There are three buttons on the thermometer, a hold button, the on/off button and the degrees Celsius/degrees Fahrenheit button. You have to press down firmly on the on/off button to get the thermometer to turn on. My only dislike in this thermometer is that the buttons are very small and I found myself having to use a fingernail to get them to work as my finger was too large and sometimes I would hit the other buttons. This is why deducted one star. Within seconds you are ready to take the temperature of your favorite cut of meat.  I compared the readings with this thermometer to another digital thermometer I had and they were both within a tenth of a degree. The feature I like best about this thermometer is the hold button. Before withdrawing the thermometer from the food, when you press the hold button it will hold the temperature reading until it is pressed again. This prevents the thermometer&#39;s temperature to fall drastically when testing another part of the meat. It also has a nice battery saving feature as it will turn itself off after 45 minutes if no buttons are pressed. It also has a nice chart on the back of the packaging  to tell you what the proper temperature of each of your meats should be.Overall, this is a great value for the price.

Wang \&quot;jwangamazon\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;I own rent properties. When properties are vacant, I take care of yard work myself. I have one 40V battery-based trimmer. I use the battery-based trimmer for properties with small yard. But two properties have a 1/4 acre yard with quite some think grass and some heavy vines also. My battery-based trimmer can barely handle the thick grass and it always struggles with the vines.I am glad to get the more powerful gas trimmer. This Remington RM2510 Wrangler is pretty lightweight...about the same weight of my 40V battery-based trimmer. The included manual gives very clear instructions about how to prime the engine and how to start it. I have no problem to start the engine. This is my 1st time to use gas-powered tool, and I am surprised how easy to start the engine. So far, based on my limited usages in one month, it usually starts within 3 pulls. The start-up instruction is also printed on the air filter hosing. So, no worry to keep the manual book around.Though it is more noisier than my battery-based trimmer, it&#39;s still in an acceptable range. This trimmer balances itself quite well. Even better yet, the curved shaft makes the trimmer head in parallel position against ground when I stand up-right. This really eases my back, especially when I use this trimmer for long period of time on the 1/4 acre yard.When it runs, the shaft does vibrate, which does not occur to my battery-based trimmer. After 40 minutes of usage, my arm does not feel sour. So, I think the vibrtion is not that bad.The trimming line is about twice as thick as my battery-based trimmer. I guess the line will last longer. When in high rpm, this trimmer sweeps through thick grass like chopping off cake with knife. And it rips though the vines easily.The package comes with a bottle of oil to be mixed with gas by user. However, the 40:1 pre-mixed gas can is widely available in Home Depot or Lowes already. The pre-mixed gas is in an easy-to-use metal can. Better yet, they add gas stabilizer additive to keep the gas last longer in the can. That&#39;s really convenient.So far, I am happy with this Remington RM2510 Wrangler trimmer.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Lightweight.

Lately there has been relatively significant traffic of moles under the soil in my yard. I have tried a wide variety of traps and poisons for moles, but not all of them have worked, but this one works if you leave it for couple of days. I usually leave it right next to the walls, on the inside of my garage. After three or four weeks, I have noticed that the poison has been consumed by the menacing rodent. This trap is safe and the bait station encloses the poisonous material inside (Bromethalin), and it is resistant to weather. It is preloaded and you don&#39;t have to handle the dangerous substance by hand. It is also kids and pet-proof.  It contains 1-ounce bar of bait per station with two stations per box. This disposable bait station has a top which is clear translucent plastic. When the poison is consumed, you can see through the clear plastic, and usually the rodent dies in its dwelling. This box can be safely disposed in the trash. This is a good alternative to glue-traps that immobilize the rodent and kills slowly and painfully. The good old-fashioned spring traps kill the pest instantly but are also dangerous to kids and the pets. I have rated this product four stars for overall satisfaction.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;This product works&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401753600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

I&amp;#8217;ve always been a fan of the way charcoal flavors food, but now that we have a toddler who loves being outside, so we have happily traded the taste of charcoal for the convenience of propane.The Grill came in a surprising number of pieces. There was a lot more assembly required then I would have thought. It took my husband a little over an hours to unpack, assemble and dispose of the packaging. So, it was pretty quick. He said the installation was easy and intuitive with good instructions. Now, my husband tends to by very good at putting things together. The installation may take a little longer for most folks.The grill itself was easy to use and did a wonderful job of cooking, although cooking with propane is a little different than cooking with charcoal. (I&amp;#8217;m sure many of you are rolling your eyes and thinking &amp;#8220;DUH&amp;#8221; right now&amp;#8230;.)I have two criticisms about this grill. The first is that the side tables snap up and down, and they are very difficult and latch. This may get easier as they become more worn, but ultimately they feel kind of cheap on what is an otherwise well-made and gorgeous grill. The other criticism is very slight, but the drip pan is a disposable aluminum tray. I wish they would have made a little more effort here and given something a little more sturdy.Overall, we are thus far thrilled with this grill. Everything we have cooked so far has been great and I&amp;#8217;m finding that I don&amp;#8217;t miss the charcoal flavor as much as I thought I would.

Mrs. Spudman, who makes the sugar water for the hummingbirds is very happy with this new feeder.  We like all of its features -  the built in bee guard, the easy to clean base, the built in ant moat, and most especially the wide mouth fill. With the wider opening of the glass nectar repository, the feeder is easier to fill and much easier to clean.Amazingly, within several minutes of hanging his new feeder our first hummer of the season made its appearance. Since then we&#39;ve had regular visits to the feeder which sits a few feet outside our large kitchen window.We&#39;re using the included red-colored nectar, but once it&#39;s been consumed we&#39;ll got back to the homemade brew without the dye.My only reservation about this feeder is the handy, but very small, built in ant moat. It appears to do its job, but on hot days the water is sure to evaporate quickly and need multiple refills. I actually prefer our large, clear ant moat that we hang above our hummingbird feeders. Small birds like to drink from these &amp;#34;moats&amp;#34;, and I like watching the chickadees use them to  bathe and splash about on hot, summer days.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;She Likes It&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398556800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 27, 2014&quot;}</td>

It is a \&quot;healthier\&quot; lawn, if you will.  The grass is thicker and stronger and crowds out a lot of weeds. In fact, the weeds seem to be repelled. Achieving his lush lawn was relatively simple using a standard fertilizer spreader.This is an organic fertilizer . Here&#39;s a brief review of the two major nutrients in lawn fertilizers:Nitrogen (N)Nitrogen is the most important nutrient in lawn fertilization. It helps grow a dense, thick lawn, by stimulating the grass plant growth, and keeps the grass green. This is the lawn food that is depleted most rapidly, but applying too much can create too much top growth and increase the need for mowing.The vivid,  dark emerald green of a lawn can be easily achieved by applying more nitrogen  (caution:  A lot of flowering plants, like peonies, do not want so much nitrogen).Phosphorus (P):Phosphates on the other hand are helpful to strengthen the root system of your lawn. Too much  run-off and leaching of phosphorus used to fertilize lawns can lead to the excessive build-up of algae and weeds in nearby lakes. For that reason, some areas suggest that you limit phosphates in lawn fertilizers to help preserve the local environment and  pose less of a threat to groundwater.  PHOSPHATES MAY EVEN BE ILLEGAL IN SOME AREAS.Mature lawns will have a lower requirement for phosphates.As this fertilizer has 0% PHOSPHATES, It can be a very helpful fertilizer.  Be environmentally friendly, conform to the legal requirements of your local area and still have the best lawn on your block!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;GREAT RESULTS: THE LAWN IS DARKER GREEN AND MORE DROUGHT RESISTANT.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398038400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 21, 2014&quot;}</td>

If you kept up with the news it&#39;s been a cold one! We placed this side-by-side with two other similar style feeders and it is the most popular of the two right now (All three have the same feed). I believe the birds like it for the larger holes/access ports. The squirrels have left it alone (or gave up on it) as we haven&#39;t seen any on or attempting to gain access to the feeder. That being said they do sit underneath it and wait for the picky bird eaters to throw down the seeds they don&#39;t like. Smart little rodents. The colors and materials which are metal are quite nicely painted and coppered. The only part that concerns me tis the plastic sheeting windows. They seem a bit on the thin side, I am presuming so they can be bent to fit the curve of the feeder, but I question how long they will survive summer heat and winter cold. I will update the review should they ever wear out. For now they are holding strong and allow us to see when the feeder is getting low. Glass would be a nicer alternative but would likely drive up the price of the unit.The other part I don&#39;t care for, but I suspect is part of the squirrel retardant features is that the wire loop it hangs from creates a lot of movement when a feathered friend comes to land on one of the stems. The feeder rotates around the wire and spins at a moderate rate until resting again naturally. This doesn&#39;t seem to bother the smaller birds, but the jays and cardinals don&#39;t care for it and pick the older feeder that has a sold bracket and does not spin.Overall I am happy with this unit so far and would give it 4 stars.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Nice option, Good to look at, a bit moving&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395273600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 20, 2014&quot;}</td>

It looks similar to this, but has only round holes (I like the round and square on this), a copper colored top, and a platform on the bottom.  I can&#39;t find it on Amazon to provide a link.  It has been one of the birds&#39; favorite feeders, especially the chickadees.  I fill it with black oil sunflower seed and they like having all of the places to access the seeds.  I have trouble with deer in my feeders and they tend to leave these alone, possibly because tilting them does not allow all of the seed to fall out.  Although the feeders don&#39;t provide seed protection from the elements, they empty it quickly enough that it has never been an issue and I have never had a feeder filled with rotten seed.There are a couple of drawbacks with both feeders.  The &amp;#34;fly through&amp;#34; holes allow small birds to perch while eating, but they also take up a lot of space, so the feeder does not hold a whole lot.  The squirrels also can access the seed and they break the wire.  This makes it difficult to fill the feeder without losing lots of seed.  Even new a fair amount of seed comes out the sides, so I fill it over a platform feeder.  The platform the other feeder has on the bottom catches some of the seed that falls out during use.  This does not have the platform.  The other feeder&#39;s copper top is also more attractive than this plain black one.Still, this has quickly been just as popular with the birds as the copper version.  Due to the size of the holes, it is really only suitable for sunflower seeds in the shell, but that is the most popular seed in my area, so that is no problem.  I think other large seeds, such as safflower, might also work.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Nice, but has issues&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395187200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 19, 2014&quot;}</td>

Schar \&quot;cxxi121\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [3, 3], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;Full disclosure:  I am a Perky-Pet fanatic for the most part.  Other feeders occupy hanging space but not one of them is as popular as any of the Perky-Pets.  The birds must know quality better than most.  This one is glass and frankly, I am a glass snob with vigor.  Glass cleans better and lasts longer while apparently not leaving any residue from cleaning.Let&#39;s start at the moat top.  Instead of having to arrange a separate contraption such as I have previously and will do again this year, this feeder has an area in the top that permits visitors from below to stop by and drown.  I&#39;ve always wondered if the dead creatures would be eaten by the hummers, but I have no evidence of that taking place.  But I always look.  The red top unscrews to permit full cleaning of the glass container.  I used a metal rod for holding plants to stakes to configure a tie down for the top&#39;s hanger.  It works well for me and I can control the size.The pinch waist permits more steady control of the feeder when holding or going from one location to another, but the real sensible addition to this feeder is the hummers&#39; goodies (food) goes into the bottom instead of the top.  Picture turning the feeder upside down with the top engaged onto the glass feeder and pouring the food into the feeder while it is sitting on the sink.  When you have filled the feeder to the level you want, screw the bottom of the unit while still upside down and carry it to the feeder.  At that point turn the unit over and place it on the Shepard&#39;s hook or whatever you use to hold the feeder.  The incidence of spillage will reduce immediately.  (As was said by someone who could spill a steel rod.)After screwing the roosts onto the main unit and assuring their proper place in front of the little feeder holes the rest is as simple.  The bottom consists of two pieces which helps with keeping the entire unit clean and the hummers appreciate it.Right now, this unit has jumped from last to first in one week&#39;s use.  Another Perky-Pet occupies that #1 position and in a few days it will be joined by another family member.  Those little critters provide so much joy to us and some of our neighbors.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Best Design So Far; Hummers Love It&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399161600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

It falls somewhere between my go toToro 51480 Corded 14-Inch Electric Trimmer/Edgerwith Walk-Behind Edging and theBlack &amp; Decker GH710 GrassHog 14-Inch 6.0-Amp Dual-Line Trimmerthat I got completely frustrated with and took back to Lowe&#39;s. I have to say, though, this Remington is definitely the heaviest string trimmer I have tried. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of the powerful motor or sturdier materials, but this thing weighs a ton. And despite the adjustable handle, at its longest it is too short for me (I&#39;m 5&#39;11\&quot;) and causes significant back strain. It also adjusts head angle and switches over to an edger, but the kludge-y design requires physically moving and adjusting the handle when changing between functions. Also, there are lots of buttons for making the adjustments, so to get the most out of the trimmer - and in some cases just to operate the thing at all - you will have to read the manual. There are some pluses among all the drawbacks though.For use as an edger, they supplied a guide wheel that allows you to set the thing down on the sidewalk, so at least when edging you don&#39;t have to support the entire weight of the device. I also liked the double string head, which really tears into grass quickly, easily, and cleanly, taking everything out in just one pass. The feed mechanism is like the Toro&#39;s, where you have to stop the engine \&quot;for two seconds\&quot; then restart it to feed about a quarter inch of line. This works sporadically at best and requires good timing and patience. After a short while, I learned to listen for the feed \&quot;click\&quot; and knew I was good to continue on, but practically speaking, it&#39;s slow going when you can only go two feet or so before having to wait a few seconds (or more for multiple feeds to catch up on the correct length) before continuing with the operation. Still, with all the power supplied, when you have the line out, its quick work and as I said, does the job in one pass. I haven&#39;t had to change the line yet, but I suspect it is more or less like every other double-line string trimmer and that will be a pain as well. (No way around that, though, so no stars deducted for that.)Overall, this has some good features and some not so good features. For a stronger, shorter person, this might be just the trimmer for you. At this price point for a double-line corded trimmer, I think the cons and pros balance out and make this just an average trimmer, which is why I rate it at three stars.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Powerful, but heavy and short. It&#39;s just okay.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398124800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 22, 2014&quot;}</td>

It&#39;s been about three years since I last washed the siding so it was pretty dirty and had a nice collection of pollen in the nooks and crannies. I have a pressure washer but I used the optional application given on the label and mixed 12 oz of HS01 with one gallon of water in a garden pump can. I wet the siding with a garden hose and then sprayed the Krud Kutter solution, working from the top down, making sure to give it a n even soaking. I waited about 10 minutes then sprayed it off with the garden hose. Some of the shaded areas had mildew growing and I had to lightly scrub these areas with a soft bristled brush on an extension pole. But the over all process with just using the solution did loosen the dirt and pollen and the hose spray washed it all off. I would consider this average results when using this method without using a power washer. After touching up some areas and brushing some of the white trim, I let it all dry. The house looks like it has a fresh coat of paint. It took two and one half gallons of mixture to complete my siding on a 1 1/2 story home that is mostly vinyl finish.Other observations: my front porch is painted concrete and my outside doors are steel. The Krud Kutter cleaned all of this with just a spray down and then hosing it off. The white trim is very bright after cleaning it, however, the white gutters had stains from rain drips and the downspouts have black stain (not mold). This product did not remove the black stains. I didn&#39;t try it on my wood deck, as there are products that are made to do that job specifically. I don&#39;t like to use my power washer on my vinyl, just a personal preference. I washed a patch of the concrete driveway, in order to use up what was left in the last pump can. the solution lightened the concrete by removing ground-in dirt, but only slightly. Concrete usually requires a power washer for clean anyway. The Krud Kutter cleans the grime from windows, but it does leave some streaking. There was no irritation of my skin, eyes, or sinus&#39;. The smell is ok and dissipates quickly.I&#39;ve used several similar products to clean the siding over the years, this one cleans a little better than the ones that I have used. I&#39;d definitely use this product again for the same job.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Cleans House and Siding&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398211200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 23, 2014&quot;}</td>

It is sturdier than you might think and it is truly functional; although not the prettiest thing in the world.  Whether it holds 100 feet of hose will depend a lot on what brand of hose you use.This is my second of these holders.  I use one for a hose I have to water the hosta beds in the back and I have another hanging in my shed to store electrical extension cords...both work and function as they are suppose to.  The one out in the elements has not rusted (yet) or bent despite being exposed to the rain and snow and despite the fact that the hose mounted on it is a rather heavy one.A couple of things to note:  First, these do not come with screws - you will have to provide your own.  When you decide on what screw to use I would strongly suggest you use it with a metal washer of some sort.  The weight of a hose, over time, could damage the mounting holes.  DON&#39;T use nails as a friend of mind did with his...nails will not hold well enough.  I personally have used rust proof screws.Nice hold if you are not expecting a high tech product...just functional.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Functional although it is nothing fancy.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398902400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

I use it along several flower borders and a few flower beds consisting of both annuals and perennials, and have not experienced any damage to my plants. I applied Preen a few weeks ago using this bottle and so far the weed count has been low - however the weather has been unusually cool this season so that could change.The addition of a battery powered spreader cap is a nice idea but for me one that works better in theory than actual use. I still had to shake the bottle at times and overall I didn&#39;t feel I had as much control. Half of my garden areas are borders and for those, manual application is more precise. For the larger garden beds, the power cap works fine.One other thing to note, with a six pound bottle it was a little weighty to hold until some of the Preen was used up. Also, the battery powered cap will fit on other bottles of Preen, so it can be saved to use again. I tried it on my organic Preen, which I use in the veggie garden, and it fit perfectly.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Significantly cuts down on the number of emerging weeds&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399248000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 5, 2014&quot;}</td>

This Ortho Dog &amp; Cat B Gon seem like a safe, non-poisonous solution to the problem.Likes:*It&#39;s the pet owners NOT the pets who are responsible for leaving poo on other people&#39;s properties.  I&#39;m glad this repellent won&#39;t harm dogs and cats.*Presumably good for training pets to prevent inappropriate spraying (marking territories), scratching, bedding, and foraging (looking for snacks).Did it work?Our front yard has natural mint plants so we already know that the peppermint oil component is ineffective.  The other main ingredients are Geraniol and Castor Oil.  I sprayed Dog &amp; Cat B Gon along the perimeter or my front lawn, concentrating on the areas where irresponsible owners had allowed their pets to defecate.  Seemed to work OK the first week (or it could be the mini-video cam I installed in the front window to catch the guilty perps).  The second week while we were out visiting friends, there were some mini dog poo towards the front of the lawn.  The larger dog poo that had appeared weeks before did not recur.  Presumably the deterrent works against larger breeds vs. smaller breeds?  Results are inconclusive.Overall:The best deterrent is still be aware of careless doofuses walking their pets and kindly warn them to leave if the pet starts sniffing around to start taking a nature break.  If they still don&#39;t leave, out comes the garden hose.  No mercy!

For my grills and smokers, I know that sentence makes me sound like a pyromaniac, but I am not.  I normally use charcoal for the grills and smokers, sometimes I use wood chunks.  I do not use lighter fluid because I am not a big fan of the chemical tastes it imparts to the food.  Plus liquid lighter fluid is just plain blasphemous to any legitimate Master of the Grill.  We would rather boil a rack of ribs than use lighter fluid to start a grill.I normally used some newspaper at the bottom of my charcoal chimney.  It works great 90% of the time.  Except that 10% of the time when it is pretty windy outside.  Then the burning paper ash blows around and lands on my wood deck.  No bueno.  And there was no way I would consider not grilling a juicy steak just because it is windy outside.  Then I tried these fire starter cubes and they work great in the chimney too.  I put in some coals, then the fire starter, light it, then add more coals.  Works great and no paper ash blowing around.The reason I started using these fire starters was because I finally elevated myself grilling/smoking to the next level and got a Big Green Egg, and everyone who has one recommends starting your charcoal with these fire starters.  I had wanted an egg for many years, but they are expensive, and seriously, are they really even worth the extra money.  Turns out they are worth it.  On my third smoking session with the egg I cooked a packer brisket for 15 hours in single digit weather.  Without a doubt it was the best brisket I have ever cooked, and the egg holds temperature like a champ!Starting the egg with these fre starters is very easy.  I fill the fire ring with charcoal then make a small depression in the coals and place half of a fire starter in that depression.  I light the fire starter, let it burn for about 20 seconds, then push some larger chunks of charcoal over it and in minutes my egg is light and i can start adjusting the temperature.  I let the temp steady out for about ten minutes to stabilize everything and to burn off the rest of the fire starter, and then I am ready to start cooking.I highly recommend these.  I cannot believe I did not start using these years ago.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;MY NEW FAVORITE FIRE STARTERS!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390867200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 28, 2014&quot;}</td>

This time, I&#39;m staying with Miracle Grow.  Some brands dissolve too quickly, and other brands seem to sit like pebbles on the soil, week after week.  This particular blend of granules works both indoors and outdoors (I find that outdoor use requires more frequent application), and it works for both flowers and vegetables.While this is a quality product, it is a general purpose one, which means that it will fertilize a broad range of plants without being tailored specifically to a particular kind, and it is not organic.  For experienced gardeners:  the formula is 12-4-8.  For less experienced one: These numbers give the percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, nutrients for plant growth.  Tomato fertilizers are generally 18-18-21, so this adds some nutrients without giving them a full-strength kick.  I find that the general purpose is best for annuals, perennials, and non-acid-loving shrubs.  (I tend to rely on more organic methods with edible herbs and vegetables.) The only thing I&#39;m not wild about is the \&quot;shake &#39;n feed\&quot; part, something that&#39;s great to broadcast the granules outside but which can make a mess when trying to spread them into pots.If you don&#39;t have the time or the memory to fertilizer your plants using organic or water-soluble fertilizers, go with the MiracleGrow.  It may cost more than other brands, but it always performs for me.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The Best Slow-Release Plant Food (5- stars)&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394409600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 10, 2014&quot;}</td>

What I like best is the heavy brass coupling that attaches to the outdoor water spigot.  My garden hoses always want to leak at the coupling, but this coupling is firm and tight.What I like least is the bright yellow stripe down the center of the bright green hose.  The stripe is much more noticeable than you would expect from the product page photo, although it&#39;s not all that hard to get used to.Unlike the cheap garden hoses that I&#39;ve been using, this hose is made of \&quot;drinking water safe\&quot; materials, and includes a \&quot;bacteria/mold inhibitor\&quot; to protect the hose.  However, to keep the hose safe for drinking water, it needs to be drained when not in regular use.  As the instructions say, \&quot;Water left in a hose for extended periods of time may result in the formation of bacteria.\&quot;This garden hose does NOT kink easily, and it&#39;s easy to coil back onto the hose holder after use.  To maximize the hose life, I always drain out some water after I turn off the spigot, because I use a \&quot;control-top\&quot; garden spray nozzle.  Sunlight or cold can expand the water left inside, and cause the hose to burst or leak prematurely.  The instructions recommend storing the hose indoors \&quot;when not in use\&quot;, which I think means during the winter months.The hose has a limited lifetime warranty against defects in materials or workmanship \&quot;under normal, residential, non-commercial use, for the &#39;Warranty Period&#39;\&quot;.  Defective hoses will be exchanged for new ones of equal or better quality.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Luxury Garden Hose Made of Drinking-Water-Safe Materials&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394323200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

I call into question their claim that pre-soaking or pre-spraying isn&#39;t necessary.  Maybe not on materials you can just hammer-down on them with the pressure washer, but for wood, etc. the product didn&#39;t seem to do much more than plain high-pressure water.  Pre-soaking might have helped, but that doesn&#39;t abide the directions on the bottle.  Other reviewers have noted similar experiences.At least it doesn&#39;t smell like Montana Solvent, and is certified to be greener than the stuff I&#39;ve used in the past.  Some of the cleaners of olden days would about eat through your sneakers.  They would definitely kill vegetation whether you rinsed them down or not.  All in all, if I were doing another deck, coated in mildew and leaf stains, I think I would just cover my plants, dillute a little Clorox and cry &#39;Havoc&#39;.This stuff seemed to be mostly about peace of mind, with not much cleaning.  My guess is there was moderate, incremental improvement in cleaning, but it wasn&#39;t astonishing.

We found more poisoned mice outside and around the building than we caught in the traps. Going to keep these outside (with a piece of wood and brick on them to keep the rain out) to help further prevent the mice from coming inside.

So it is true with pigeons, who are known to carry diseases that are very harmful to humans. They also leave a mess where they roost. In my climate pigeons tend to make their homes in areas that help to keep them out of the hot sun. I don&#39;t wish to harm them, only to discourage them from roosting in certain areas where their droppings have the potential of spreading disease or disfiguring the exterior walls of the house. In my house there are really only 2-3 such areas, one of them right over the front entrance door.Previously we had used \&quot;chicken wire\&quot; to prevent the pigeons from roosting in these areas.  However it is unattractive and it is possible the birds could become enmeshed in the wire, which is not the intent.During a recent whole-home remodel in which the exterior was repainted, we removed all of the chicken wire and added Bird B Gone spikes in the two areas in which pigeon droppings could potentially fall on children, guests or food.  We started with the stainless steel spikes and also wanted to compare the Lucite spikes which cost less.  This review compares the two.Despite the fact that the Lucite spikes are clear, the stainless steel spikes actually call less attention to themselves. Both have pointy ends that discourage unwanted guests from roosting but neither would be considered harmful or lethal to wildlife as they are more of a deterrent.The pro for the metal spikes is that they are shiny and wave in the wind which makes noise, all of which discourage the birds before they even get near. The downside of that is that the vibration can get a little annoying to humans in the house. For any given length they are a bit lighter than the plastic version.  Another downside is that the cost is quite a bit more.The pro for the plastic spikes is that they cost less and are equally as effective. They are very rigid and do not vibrate. But the clear material is also shiny and will most likely discourage a bird before it even comes close. I tried to break off a spike of the plastic variety and it did not break easily. Time will tell which best survives harsh weather conditions (I will update this review if I find any huge advantages of one over the other).A couple of final observations ...1. Installation with glue is much easier than installing with screws. Nobody wants to make screw holes in their roof nor glue anything to it but it&#39;s a necessary evil and let&#39;s face reality, most people will never remove bird spikes once they are installed.2. If you use glue be sure to put a dollop of glue where each screw hole is. The glue will ooze through the hole and act as a very strong screw to help hold the strip down.3. Be sure to let the spikes hang over the edge of the mounting surface 1 - 2\&quot;. This will help discourage the birds before they start to roost.4. Try mounting the strip with the spikes pointing out rather than up (this works especially well with the plastic strips). This mounting will be just as effective with almost no risk of harming the bird or catching debris.  In my installation it also makes the Lucite plastic spikes much less visible from street level.If birds are a nuisance or potential health hazard where you live, bird spikes can be a worthwhile way of telling the birds to seek shelter elsewhere without harming them. Bird B Gone seems to own the residential market for such products (although there are many, more expensive, solutions) and they are reasonably well made. They are not cheap but after all this is one of those expenses you do once and shouldn&#39;t have to think about again for many years down the road.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Very effective and humane&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396828800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

As such I have not been able to give it a functional test (and probably won&#39;t until the Fall).  However, since Amazon VINE issues a review deadline, I will comment strictly on the appearance and construction. From an appearance standpoint, the fire pit is fairly nice from a distance.  Up close , however, you can see the construction/packing/shipping flaws which give it the air of an older beat up pit.  In particular, the bowl has a major &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; in the upper flat lip.  I&#39;ve considered that this is by intent to give it a more rustic flair, but since it prevents the spark guard from sitting properly on the top, I doubt it.  Also about 1/3 around the top, also on the flat lip is a &amp;#34;ding&amp;#34; which looks like someone gave it a mighty whack with a ball peen hammer.  The material seems to be stronger than plain old copper so I have not been able to fix either imperfection by hand.  Finally, the cover supplied is rather flimsy and I don&#39;t think it will last long in our Chicago weather.  All in all, I would have to say that had I paid ~$300 for this I would have returned it as defective.  As it is, as the weather normalizes and evenings cool a bit, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get some use out of the pit.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Questionable quality&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403654400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 25, 2014&quot;}</td>

It comes with a solar panel, 2 LED lamps (high &amp; low settings), an independent portable lantern that is quite bright on the high setting, and a power pack to charge mobile phones via a USB jack (6 adaptors included).We put the solar panel on the roof near the back of the house, the east side, where it gets lots of sunshine.  Plugging the LED lights into the control unit there is ample cord to extend the lights to the extremities of our 30 foot long deck.  We let the unit charge all of one day before trying it and it worked perfectly.  The lights lit up the deck area sufficiently to read outside if you wish, and the lantern was bright enough to light areas of the yard as we walked.However, the 2nd night we had a heavy snowfall accompanied by freezing rain and the unit put out very little power.  I suppose it is similar to all solar panels and subject to that limitation.  As the weather breaks this SHS will be moved to the back of our lot to light the storage sheds.  That is where this will be really helpful.  Lighting an area that is almost in total darkness with no streetlights around.  I will try to find a way to shelter the solar panel from heavy snow and ice during winter times, but its primary usage will be in spring, summer, and fall for yard work and home construction projects.By the way, the lantern included in this kit has several reviews on its own on Amazon.com.  The reviews are quite positive, which was my initial experience.  I am hopeful the lantern and the lights will decrease the activity of varmints in our back yard garden.  Electricity rates are too high to leave lights on all night, but the solar powered unit will eliminate those costs.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great idea with some limitations&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395792000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

It helps collect rain water which can then be used for other household purposes, helping to save money and conserve resources.I have used other rain barrels but this is the first one I have owned that is solid in construction. In fact, if I have to name one aspect of this rain barrel I like best, it would be the solid, sturdy design. It seems like it can stand up to the elements and withstand any type of inclement weather. Lucky for me, it doesn&amp;#8217;t snow where I live but the durable design is good for those who live in harsher climates.With its attractive, neutral design, this rain barrel matches up well with most outdoor d&amp;eacute;cor and I like that it has two spigots for convenience. There is also the ability to place a plant on top, as you can see in the picture. I haven&amp;#8217;t done this and, given how shallow the space on top is, I don&amp;#8217;t know if placing a plant here is really a good idea. If it was deeper, perhaps so, but it&amp;#8217;s so shallow that most plants won&amp;#8217;t fare very well.The things that bother me a little with this rain barrel are its lack of a removable top and issues with installation. There is a screen on top to help prevent debris and bugs from getting inside. And it&amp;#8217;s a good thing the rain barrel has this because there is no way to open the top for cleaning. The best you could do is remove the small screen and try to find something narrow to stick through the small opening for cleaning. The screen will keep out leaves and other things, but if the barrel gets smelly and needs an interior cleaning job, there is little you can do.With the installation, I did have some small issues and concerns. You need to place this rain barrel directly under a downspout and because it is so tall, that will likely mean removing a large section of your downspout in order to fit the rain barrel underneath. Depending on your particular downspout design, it could be a problem and you may have to cut off a portion of the spout to get it situated just right. Then, there could be issues with the spigots. They provide tape to help form a good seal, but only time will tell if the seal holds up and the water doesn&amp;#8217;t leak.Overall, however, I like the Good Ideas Palm Rain Barrel and recommend it for most homes. It helps conserve water, performs adequately, and looks nice in my backyard. It could stand for some improvements, but it is still a good device for water conservation.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Save Water with Good Ideas Palm Rain Barrel&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398902400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

Not an instant kill, but you will see a bunch in the next few hours below the hive.  Then you keep spraying until you soak the whole hive with the substance.  Repeat when the foam gets absorb or drips to the ground.  The next day, you can break the hive and throw the debris in the trash.The 20 ft claim is a stretch though.  That is the maximum and it reaches that far only for several seconds.  Make sure that you are heating your mark accurately in the first instance if you have to do it from long distance.  After that you have to get closer for you to reach your mark.I was also worried that it will stain my window pane and sills after it dries up. The hive is located just above my front window.

Andersen \&quot;redheaded booklover\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;I like house plants. I have maybe 30 or so at this time. Probably half of the plants I have are Christmas cactus (schlumberga russelliana mostly)and while they are pretty foliage wise through out the entire year, the shorter days towards November and December cause them to flower, thereby giving these plants the common name of Christmas cactus.and they will come back every year, provided you keep them  in natural sunlight until the buds set on them. (No indirect light at night, it will mess up the blooming time.)Christmas cacti are fairly fragile when you repot them or move them, Sometimes there are loose segments that you can grow into a new plant. A good Christmas present is easy to make from the loose segments and the Take Root Rooting Hormone.Now you don&#39;t absolutely _need_ the Take Root Rooting Hormone.  You can put the little segments in a cup of water and they will take a few weeks to root providing they don&#39;t rot.  You could stick them in dirt and they will probably root if they don&#39;t dry out. Either of these strategies will take quite a few weeks to see it the segments actually do root.If you take a segment of a Christmas cactus and put the tiniest bit of the Take Root rooting hormone on the open stem and place it in dirt (and keep the dirt just a little damp), the segment will root much quicker and grow stronger than if you just use the water or dirt method. You can cut segments, dust them with the rooting hormone and quickly have a thriving pot of Christmas cacti, If you want to make sure you have tem ready for a Christmas gift, you must root them at least 6 months prior to December to ensure bloom, This  time will allow the plants to become well established.Of course, you can use the rooting hormone for any plant you want to.  I use it when transplanting plants into the garden. It helps the new plants to be established quickly.I recommend Taking Root Rooting Hormone highly to any one who has house plants or outside plants. It gives you the opportunity to increase your plants quickly at a minimum cost. And as any gardener knows, that is terrific,_enjoy_&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;to have a pot of Christmas Cacti&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392422400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

When testing this, I also wondered about what the neighbors were thinking. Then I remembered that they had frequently let me know such, so all was well.Assembly should have been a snap. Unfortunately one of the bolts for the legs was poorly threaded. I had neither the right sized black metric bolt nor the right threading in my tap and die set to rethread the bolt or the hole. So, to put on one of the legs I had to use a bolt I had that was almost right and force it in with some thin metal stock as a shim to make the hole a little smaller. Thus a ten minute assembly took over an hour.This has a very nice appearance and, once assembled, is quite sturdy. The lid fits well enough, though it&#39;s circular shape is not quite the same as the circular shape of the bowl. I&#39;m hesitant to put too much force on the lid to change its shape. It does contain the ashes while burning. There is also a vinyl cover for it (when not in use).The grate is sturdy enough, though I would have preferred that the spacing between its bars to have been smaller. It is difficult to use tender to get the fire started without it falling to the bottom of the bowl. I have taken a smaller grate from another grill to go crosswise and it works much better.Overall, this looks nice on the patio, burns well and I&#39;m sure we will use it more often once the appropriate season gets here.

Great idea, as the ants can really be a problem here certain times of the year.It holds 16 ounces of nectar, which is plenty for around here.  We don&#39;t get hordes of hummers so if the nectar sits in there too long without being emptied, it gets fouled.The only drawback I can see is that the base on the bottom says &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; with arrows showing the direction, but it seems to just press-fit, with no threads to actually secure it?

Reader&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [4, 4], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;To start with, I really do love animals.  Although not a vegetarian, I&#39;m not a hunter, and choose to leave wildlife be when I can.  I feed birds in the winter, etc.  However, there are times when nuisance encroaching animals just have to go.  I prefer to live catch and relocate (rats are an exception, and I have readily resorted to poison).  I&#39;ve owned and used a larger Havahart for years, having great success at trapping and relocating everything from nuisance possums, to raccoons, to poaching cats on the farm.  My early impression with this smaller trap, is that it is much easier to trap the larger varmints than the smaller ones. The smaller animals have much less body weight, and of course can maneuver in remarkably small spaces, and their survival instincts lead them to be quite inventive.I took this offer for the Havahart 1061 from Amazon to specifically try to thin out  the gray squirrel traffic here at my in-town home.  The grays are much smaller than the larger red squirrels and I thought I&#39;d try this small trap.Features on this trap are Two-Door access (one on each end),  the &amp;#34;Easy Set&amp;#34; system, 17.25&amp;#34; length, 5&amp;#34;x5&amp;#34; opening.  I don&#39;t know how to account for some the of the bad experiences in the other reviews, but setting the trap that I received is a breeze!  Simply rotate the setting handle back, and the cable system sets the trap nicely.The 5&amp;#34;x5&amp;#34; opening sounded awfully small, but when finally viewing live, I knew it would be just right for my gray squirrels.  And it is.  Two catches already using peanuts, and also a catch and release small bunny (they are relatively few here and not a problem for me).  I took the squirrels to a nearby lake/park location where there are plentiful walnut trees (yum!).  I have had  a couple incidences of finding an empty tripped trap . . . maybe an escape, but more likely tripped from an outside disturbance . . . this trap is sensitive!  I&#39;ve also had a couple incidences of stolen bait . . . on that I suspect the local blue jays, which have displayed a vigorous taste for peanuts (I had tossed peanuts out, no trap, for several days in advance to &amp;#34;bait the area&amp;#34;).  I suppose a blue jay is also capable of being caught in this thing - maybe so far they&#39;ve stayed off of the tripping platform.I will definitely keep this trap on hand for any future mice or (forbid) another rat.  No subject nuisance mice targets yet, so I&#39;ll have to take Havahart&#39;s word that it works on mice.  The mesh is small, but so are mice.  And the tripping mechanism is sensitive, but mice don&#39;t weigh much.  We&#39;ll see. I DO like the notion of using this for mice, rather than the traditional wooden neck breaker mouse traps I have used in the past on mice (mice seem nice, but just don&#39;t want them in my home).In all, great trap, typical from Havahart:  Sturdy, easy to set, sensitive, and not injurious to animals (notwithstanding the trauma of being caught in the trap . . . so please monitor a set trap often and relocate and release immediately).&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;No brainer setting.  Works. Some escapes and stolen bait?&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399161600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

I think this was for two reasons.First the test to find an active tunnel is to push said mounds done then check to see if they are back up the next day... the process of using the bottle&#39;s pointed end though also collapses part of the tunnel and if I were a mole and my tunnel had a collapsed section two days in a row, I&#39;d find me a new tunnel (which is what they seemed to have done).Second the process of making said hole to pour the pellets into not only collapses the tunnel around it but actually blocks off the tunnel at that point.  Once more the moles just made a new tunnel.Very disappointing.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Collapsed Tunnels Too Much&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402963200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 17, 2014&quot;}</td>

This applicator has two main advantages over placing mole bait by hand. First, if you use latex gloves to load it, you can avoid human odor on the bait, which may render the bait useless given the sensitive noses of moles. Second, of course, you can apply the bait in various places around the yard while standing, and when finished simply hang the applicator in your yard shed or garage.I&#39;ve found that, although the process is quite simple, it can be tricky to get the bait pellets in the right spot. The tunnels are easy to spot in most lawns and gardens, but placing the bait is important. Even if you happen to collapse part of the tunnel, moles love to reopen them if it means getting at some food. However, I think it is best to cover the hole left by the applicator with some dry leaves and a little soil on top of that. This way, the bait is somewhat protected from other creatures and the weather, plus it is easy to see where bait has been placed if you wish to check on whether it&#39;s been eaten.Bottom line: if you have a mole problem and tried a number of approaches to getting rid of them, this applicator may help. In my opinion, traps are effective if they are placed just so (I&#39;ve had little luck with them), but bait and mole-killer &amp;#34;worms&amp;#34; work best.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Handy tool for the infested yard&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400112000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

It has brass fitting and has very nice looking body.If you get low rain fall amounts this is a very cute barrel.I live in the mid west and we get huge rain down pours, this barrel has no way to direct over flow. It fills and runs along a small track to pour off the front. I have other rain barrels that I can daisy chain together , this one has two drains, one down low and one half way up, it won&#39;t work for over flow unless I have it set higher than the other barrels. Since I don&#39;t want water to run over next to my foundation I chose to install this barrel below a gutter on a shed away from the house. So if you live some where with low rain fall amounts or have a small gutter on a covered deck or the like, this is a very nice looking rain barrel with good fittings. If you can get large amounts of rain in a short time and have foundation issues or don&#39;t want to go out and flip a diverter switch in the middle of a rain storm, you might want to look for a larger barrel or better over flow system.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Very nice looking just be careful where you install it&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398816000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

The pole which is not included, but virtually any yard tool handle will work, was easy to insert and remove via a foot pedal that opens and secures or releases the inserted handle.

The B&amp;D CM1640 Cordless mower is for that electronic vehicle lover in ya. Sure your using home energy to charge the batteries, but you aren&#39;t using gas anymore, and thats pretty cool. If you have a small lawn and don&#39;t let the grass grow to high, then this is the right mower for you. Yes, you have to get out there every week or so to keep the lawn from getting to high, but its worth it in the end. I have a small beach house with just a small front lawn, and this is perfect for it. Assembly was straightforward, just stick to the script in the manual. The grass catcher must be attached which I knocked a star off of it for, so no cutting grass without it. It comes with two batteries and they last about 15-30 minutes each. It is very easy to start, and like I mentioned before, envirofriendly! Overall, I highly recommend this mower for those with a green conscious or those with small lawns.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great for small lawns and beach houses&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402876800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

We thought this would be a great product to try being new to the hot tub / spa world as we learn our chemical balance needed for the spa. We figured this would be a quick and easy way to get rid of any foam we saw.First - It does work, yes your foam will disappear within moments. So if you needed a &amp;#34;quick fix&#39; maybe this is for you? Personally we don&#39;t like it. We never had a scum line and the following week one was present - But the product says it helps that? That same week our water was cloudy and a little odor to it for the first time ever. We did try it again as directly and added chlorine as needed but noticed our PH was off to. We had the same issue, actually that week had even more foam! Yes it did all go away when the product was added- but we rather not have an odor cloudy scum line spa at its costs.We find that as long as the PH is correct (simply a PH up we use) their is no foam, no scum line, water clear and not smelly. Of course we add chlorine as needed, but the PH certainly controls the rest and no need for this product at all.It recommends it for pool use too.... though I never saw a pool have &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; in it before? Even if its for a quick fix, I&#39;m not so sure this would be your answer. Perhaps checking your water, seeing if the PH etc are off and using proper chemicals to maintain it is all you need then starting to add in an &amp;#34;additive&amp;#34;.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Bye Bye Foam - Hello Water Cloudness..

Original review is here: ****I bought my first electric lawn mower when I bought my first house in 2004. It was a Black and Decker MM675 with a flip-over handle. That lawn mower served me well for about 5 years and never let me down. Then, one day I used it when my lawn was too wet and the motor started to smoke as it bogged down on wet grass! I could no longer get the MM675 model, so I went to Home Depot and \&quot;upgraded\&quot; to the MM1800, the 18\&quot; corded mulching/bagging mower from Black and Decker. Immediately I was dissatisfied. It didn&#39;t feel as strong as my old mower, was more unwieldy, and had this awful plastic shroud that made it hard to maneuver. Everything on it felt cheap, and two years later, it died on me while mowing grass that was not that thick (the motor blew out and smoked).  I replaced it with aGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerand never looked back - that was a great corded mower and I used it until I found this new B&amp;D; Mower.For mowing my own lawn, I did not consider gas because I don&#39;t have the room to keep fuel around and I have a modest size yard. I have always relied on corded mowers because I felt the battery operated ones would be too weak and I didn&#39;t want to deal with battery management.  Cords are a fine option, but sometimes you do want the freedom of a battery.All of that being said, B&amp;D; really did a nice job with this battery operated mower, and for the first time in my adult mowing life, I think I might be back to both B&amp;D; (and using battery operation).Opening the box, I found the mower in 3 pieces.  The battery was pre-installed (with half-charge), so all I had to do to assemble the mower was attached the handle.  The handle attaches in 2 parts.  You need to unscrew the 2 bolts on each side and screw them back in, but once installed, they loosen with a simple lever.  This allows you to collapse the handle easily for storage.  I have had \&quot;easy fold\&quot; handles before, but this one is actually easy.  The mower is very light, and with a handle on top of the body of the mower, I was easily able to lift it up and put it away in my crawl space.  I could do that with a gas or my previous corded mower.The mower includes two 40V B&amp;D; LBXR2036 Lithium Batteries.  It says it is compatible with the lower voltage 36V LBXR36 batteries, but gives no indication of the performance difference.  This could be important because the 36V batteries are $80 and the 40V are $110.  So understand that you are getting over $200 worth of batteries with this mower and that is likely where much of the cost lies.  The batteries are the new Lithium Ion batteries which should hopefully not hold memory like the old NiCad.  You also get a really nice charger which has \&quot;smarts\&quot; to let you know when a battery is charged.  Each battery also has a \&quot;power gauge\&quot; to let you know how much power is left.Enough about the batteries - how does it mow?  I went outside shortly after it rained for the first mow of the season.  Yes - I was challenging the mower on all fronts.  I plugged in the safety key (great feature to keep your mower off when you aren&#39;t around - it appears to be \&quot;smart\&quot; and won&#39;t let you just short out the terminals).  I also decided not to bag initially.  The deck height setting is very easy - a single lever adjusts the deck.  I tried on setting 2 and made it surprisingly far until I bogged down the mower (no surprise - the grass was tall and wet).  Most impressively, the mower stopped on tall grass and didn&#39;t burn out like my older corded mowers did.  It appears to know not to destroy itself.  You have to actually turn it off and then back on to get going, a nice feature to prevent you from overstressing the motor.  I set it higher (to 6) and mowed just fine.In terms of performance, I was able to mow my backyard with 1 battery and my front yard with the other.  Each worked for about 20 minutes (not quite the 30 advertised).  The mower cuts off quickly when the battery is dead, so no period of \&quot;weak mowing\&quot; when you&#39;re not sure if you should replace it.  When it&#39;s dead, it&#39;s dead.The bag is very easy to attach and you don&#39;t need to fight to keep it open like other bags.  It can&#39;t hold much, so you&#39;ll be emptying it a lot on heavy grass.A few other notes - the mower is very easy to turn and navigate thanks to the wide tires and oversized rear tires.  Unfortunately they are plastic (not rubber or real tires), but they seem to get the job done.  The mower is a total of about 17\&quot; wide, so it will fit into very tight space, but it also means you might need to make more passes on your lawn than a wider mower.Overall, I was able to mow easily and certainly appreciated not having to handle cord management.  If you have a yard that can be mowed fully in 40 minutes and you don&#39;t want to mess with power cords, this mower is certainly a fine choice.  All of that being said, be aware that you can get a high quality corded mower (like the Greenworks 25022) for a little more than the cost of 1 battery for this mower.  It makes the decision an economic and personal one - is it worth twice the cost to you to get a mower that is lighter and does not require a cord?  If the answer is \&quot;yes\&quot;, then you will be quite happy with this B&amp;D; Mower.**** UPDATE 5/15/2014 ****Sadly I had to knock it down to two stars today.  While mowing, I hit a few rocks which is common around here (very rocky soil).  My old Greenworks mower has a few small dings on the blade from hitting rocks, but it&#39;s been going strong for years with the dings.  However, the small ding knocked the B&amp;D; CM1640 totally out of balance.  It started vibrating and shaking while I mowed.  I hit a few more small rocks and it got worse.  These weren&#39;t giant rocks mind you, but small ones that I have accidentally mowed with countless other mowers.  As I pushed on, the mower caught a root and it was all over.  The blade literally bent 90 degrees (see photo I uploaded).  It is now trash.  Maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about rocks, and maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about roots?  Both are possible, but all I can say is that I abuse my Greenworks mower and every season it starts right up.  I have hit quartz, granite, and just about everything else in my yard, and it is still humming.So why do I think this happened?  I have a theory - it&#39;s a battery operated motor meaning they need to optimize everything to draw the lowest amount of current possible.  Looking at the blade, it appears they have made it thinner and lighter than a typical blade so it spins fast without drawing as much current.  The downside is what I just discovered - a fragile mower that breaks easily.One other thing I discovered - the batteries cannot be recharged immediately because they tend to get too hot.  The charger won&#39;t charge them.  So you can&#39;t recharge battery 1 while you mow with battery 2.  Another issue!I am going back to myGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerwhere you can read my review of that fine mower.  Once again I left it outside, under my deck, all winter, and it finished up my yard for me today great.  A few minutes with it reminded me why I left B&amp;D; in the first place.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Update - it lasted 2 weeks and then the blade bent 90 degrees on a root - a real shame&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398902400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

This little baby monitors the heat and keeps it at the temperature that you set it for.  I used to use the heating pad method under my seedling trays, but now they make most of them that turn off after a certain amount of time and that leaves the seedlings cold and without heat.  I bought two of the Hydrofarm seedling heat mats, plugged this digital thermostat in and never turned back.  I used it this Spring in the little conservatory where I keep the citrus trees in the winter.  It performed flawlessly.

I know it is my Brome bird feeders that attract such a wide array of birds to my backyard. These wonderful squirrel-proof feeders truly expand my enjoyment of bird watching in Florida. And they really foil those darn squirrels.This Brome bird feeder is ingenious and so well made! It&#39;s also very easy to use. What&#39;s more, it looks great. This is a beautiful feeder made even more beautiful by the birds it attracts.If you really want a squirrel proof wild bird feeder I highly recommend any of  the Bromes. Bromes are expensive but they are worth every penny. My Brome feeders paid for themselves in no time, just by what they save me in all the birdfeed that the squirrels cannot access.The only thing I love more than feeding my wild birds is feeding my wild birds from all of my Brome guaranteed squirrel proof bird feeders.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;This beautiful squirrel-proof bird feeder expands my enjoyment of bird watching&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395532800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 23, 2014&quot;}</td>

When the water is turned off, it takes a few seconds as it draws up to about a third of the full size. The hose then can be gathered up to the size of a loaf of bread and it weighs about as much. Not bad for a 50 foot hose with brass fittings. It doesn&#39;t take much space to store it, so it would be ideal for campers, boats, etc. Anywhere a hose would be handy to have but space is limited.

I have a very large (~10,000 sf)  and somewhat hilly lawn, and for the past 15 years I&#39;ve used a big, twin-bladed, 33\&quot; cutting path, 10.5 hp, self-propelled, four-speed, semi-pro Craftsman lawnmower.  It was fast (I could do the whole yard in 40 minutes), but it was loud and required all the usual small-engine maintenance.I just mowed the lawn for the first time using the Greenworks battery-powered mower and I couldn&#39;t be happier.  I expected it to take much longer, because of the narrower cutting path, but it went faster than I expected because the mower is so light and maneuverable that I wasted less time doing turns.  I was worried about it not being self-propelled, but again the light weight of the mower really made a difference.  It was more of a workout that walking behind the Craftsman self-propelled mower, but not bad at all.  I&#39;d liken it to pushing a high-wheeled stroller with an infant on board.On this first pass, I took off the bag and used the mower in mulching mode.  It worked very effectively, including on the occasional pine cone.  My grass is mostly fescue, which is fairly thin, and the mower cut it easily and evenly.  In a couple of thicker patches the electric engine rev&#39;d up automatically and handled the denser turf just fine.Starting the mower is very simple -- push one button and pull back the lever.  Much more convenient than starting my old lawnmower with its pull cord.  One delightful (and unexpected) advantage is that the mower is much quieter than my old gas mower.  I always used to wear ear protection when mowing, but didn&#39;t need to with this electric mower.  My family reported that it was also much, much quieter inside the house.One thing I&#39;m looking forward to is the lack of maintenance and not having to prep the mower for winter storage, or change the oil, or store gas.I can charge the batteries from our solar panels, which makes this a very green solution.  I was surprised to learn recently that small gas-powered engines in lawn equipment are very dirty compared to modern cars, so this small change of mower makes a big difference in terms of my environmental footprint.The mower comes with two batteries, a 4ah and 2 ah.  Both can be installed at the same time, and the mower automatically switches to the second battery when the first runs out.  Unfortunately, the combination was not quite enough to finish my lawn.  Two 4ah batteries would be sufficient, and I wish this option were available when purchasing the mower.  A second 4ah battery is pretty expensive, but because Greenworks prices its bundles (i.e., piece of equipment together with a battery and charger) pretty aggressively relative to the cost of batteries alone, you can get a spare battery at fairly low marginal cost if you buy multiple Greenworks products.  As it turned out, I also wanted a cordless electric leafblower, so I ordered a Greenworks leafblower plus battery and I now have three interchangeable batteries, which is more than enough for my lawn.Bottom line:  This mower cuts smoothly and evenly, mulches well, does an average to large lawn on one charge, is light enough to push without needing to be self propelled, is much quieter than a gas mower, needs less maintenance than gas-powered small engines, and is seriously green (especially if you have solar panels like we do).  For me, it makes mowing a lot more fun (or at least a lot less of a chore).  Two thumbs up.Update May 5:  I ordered this mower through Amazon.  I ordered some additional items directly from Greenworks website.  One of the packages arrived, but another got lost in transit.  I emailed Greenworks over the weekend and received a reply first thing this morning that they would ship a replacement today.  Couldn&#39;t ask for a faster or more complete resolution.  So, in addition to really liking the product, I&#39;m also impressed by the responsiveness of their customer service.  I hope this company does well.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great Battery Mower At Last:  Quiet, convenient, green&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399248000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 5, 2014&quot;}</td>

The glue used to hold the chlorine tablets together eventually coats the screw on lids (since they&#39;re filled to the top with water), and even with an incredible amount of force I wasn&#39;t able to open them after a period of years.  I bought this one in order to get away from that problem and it appears to work well.  I&#39;m a bit surprised at how little chlorine actually gets dissolved in this unit.  I put five 3&amp;#34; tablets in, and after a week there was still about 2.5 tablets left.  It isn&#39;t summer yet, so algae isn&#39;t a problem at the moment.  Then again, the water isn&#39;t very warm.  Perhaps when the water warms up the tablets will dissolve faster.

I have the best results when I use cutting from new growth early in the season.For good results you should have very clean cutting tools (sterilized with bleach or rubbing alcohol), fresh perlite or a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; potting soil &amp; a sterilized container.I cut a bunch of fresh growth woody stems then I take them back to my work area and I cut them to about 8&amp;#34; long near a &amp;#34;node&amp;#34;, remove all the leaves but one, make sure the cut end is cut at an angle, wet the stems &amp; then dip them in the rooting compound &amp; then push into the perlite or potting soil.  You can put them very close together - 1&amp;#34; or so apart.  I always cut several more than I need because they won&#39;t all survive.  If you get lucky &amp; they all grow, you&#39;ll have plants to share.Keep out of sunlight &amp; keep moist but not too wet or they will rot.  It may take a couple weeks (depends on the plant) but I check them by VERY gently pulling on a stem to see if roots are growing.  If there is a bit of tension when you pull, you probably have roots.  Try not to pull them all the way out or you&#39;ll break the tender growth.The cuttings usually spend a couple months in the pot &amp; then I separate them &amp; plant them in 4-6&amp;#34; pots.  You could even plant them in the ground in a very protected area where you can keep watch over them for another season.  I sometimes put them in a small corner in my garden so they can grow undisturbed until they are big enough to move.It all depends on the type of plant you are propagating.  If it&#39;s an easy woody plant to grow, it will probably be easy to root from cuttings.  I&#39;ve had really good luck (plenty to give away) with Limelight Hydrangea, varieties of Ninebark &amp; Forsythia.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Inexpensive way to get more plants/bushes - It works&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393545600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 28, 2014&quot;}</td>

Once you get phosphates under 500 you can use this.If you have an algae bloom like I did before finding this stuff this company also has a super concentrate called first aid.

They distinguish themselves with the best grills I have ever encountered: nice heavy porcelain cast iron. The grills heat evenly and provide great results.I have only had propane Webers before. So I was very intrigued about how an electric grill would work and the results. Well the results are fantastic. The body is very well engineered. It provides a nice seal which essentially makes the grill a convection oven. The taste is very &#39;clean&#39;. but you still get grill flavor. But your seasoning and the nice quick sear is what is giving you flavor. There is no slight gas flavor, which is a plus to me.Steaks have come out heavenly. But bone-in chicken, wow. Moist, crisp, tender, juicy. I put it perhaps a little past medium high as recommended for the chicken but it came out great. The steaks were on high and so juicy.There are a couple of limitations to be aware of. There is a suggested 20 minute warm up time before you put food down. I have followed this. Certainly for steaks on high you want the grill to be nice and warm. But you should be aware of that before ordering if that is a concern. Second there is &#39;only&#39; a 6 foot cord and they suggest you don&#39;t use an extension cord. This is a problem for us and I would suspect for others. We can reach an outlet from a table, but it is stretched across off the ground. Not good if you have little kids. Of course if you buy a cart this is not a problem.One other small suggestion. Put the handle on before you attach the cover in back to the main body. It was awkward to attach the handle after the top was connected. But overall very little assembly.Even with the small issues this was easily a 5. I am finding myself not wanting to use my other grills. If you are in a situation without having access to propane or charcoal, bam this guy will have you grilling as well as anyone else. But even without having any limitations, I really like the easy temp control and not having to buy propane this grill affords. And the results are delicious.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Review of the Q2400 Weber electric: love it, great results; juicy steaks, perfect chicken, easy to use&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391040000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

They fully covered my hands and were very effective. While there is snow outside, and I can&#39;t test them on the BBQ and/or fire pit, the oven has convinced me that these are safe.A couple of uses I often have - I keep a baking stone in the oven and have been known to turn on the oven before removing it. With these, no problem, just need to put the baking stone on a cookie rack so it doesn&#39;t crack. On Thanksgiving, I often forget to remove the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; metal shelf in the oven that needs to be moved or removed before I can put the turkey in. I have burned my hands doing this - again, these protect fully making this job possible as well.Since I sometimes don&#39;t want or need a full glove, I have also grabbed these and used them as hot pads for a quick pick up of a hot item. Even used this way, the silicone texture makes them much more slip proof.The loops inside work perfectly on the loops I have on my stove to hold hot pads, so they are always ready to go.I am grateful to have received a complimentary set to test so that I could write a review and am happy to be able to give them a good rating.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Nice, inside and out&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391385600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

(I live in a place with high humidity,  salt in the air, enormous amounts of rain. I have not seen rust-proof yet, but we will see.)  I will update this review if I do see signs of rust.  If I do not I will be very impressed.It is better built and nicer looking than our other hose hangers, but not as easy to use as the reels, particularly with long hoses.

Step 3 you fasten the Snap-on frame handle with two Phillips screws the same size as the ones used for the crank. If you work slowly the entire assembly process may take up to 5 minutes.The pneumatic tires provide a smooth and easy way to move the cart around. The reel can hold a mile or so of hose.

It&#39;s like a bird bar, a welcoming watering hole for hummingbirds.As others on the U.S. boards have noted, you will need to take a small bottle brush to clean this and it is recommended that you clean it once a week.  I also like the fact that it came with a bag of nectar.  However, the only thing that bothered me was that the nectar was red.  Food dye is not good for hummingbirds.  When I make hummingbird food, I boil up sugar in water (usually 1:1 ratio).

It is pretty hefty and sturdy. The switches were initially quite stiff but I added a drop of oil (as per instructions) and they loosened up. Once installed all the connections fit well and does not leak. So far so good.

Same price as here, by the way. Set them that evening, in the dark, using the technique advocated by other reviewers here... that is, gently tamped down a small section of a main, straight run until level with ground, cut grooves on either side for the trap jaws to sit in, set tap, and set trap down in grooves with the release lever sitting against the tamped-down ground.  One day passed with no action, but after a whole lot of rain yesterday evening, the mole was in the trap this morning!He was caught in the edge of the jaws, telling me I could have planted the trap a tiny bit deeper.  There is another method advocated online involving digging out a section of the mole run, building a dirt bridge across the hole, placing the trap down in the hole, and covering with dirt.  This might be an even better strategy, but either way, I&#39;m happy with the result.  I left the traps out, just in case another mole decides to make use of his subterranean highway system.

Their foliar sprays are very fast acting, but short-lived; the Shake&#39;n Feed products incorporate both fast-acting fertilizer and a polymer-coated slow-release component.  The combination provides an immediate boost, plus a long tail.Application - The package says that a single application lasts up to three months.  This 4-1/2 pound package will feed roughly 135 sq. ft. if you&#39;re using it in a flower bed.Composition - Nitrogen - 9%; Phosphate - 19%; Potash - 9%; Sulfur - 20%  Some (6%-12.5%-6%) of the Nitrogen, Phosphate and Potash has a polymer coating to allow for slow-release.  Note that this formulation, unlike it&#39;s all-purpose brethren, does not have any trace minerals.  It also has a substantially higher sulfur content, which helps to lower your soil pH.Usage - I live in California, in an area with a long growing season.  In Spring, I&#39;ll first apply Miracle-Gro All-Purpose plant food (also in the Shake&#39;n Feed container).  That formula has a higher nitrogen content to help plants get growing.  A few months later, I&#39;ll switch to this around the flowering plants.  It&#39;s not exactly a rigorously-tested protocol, but in practice, the combination works extremely well.Highly Recommended.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Flowering plants eat this up!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395014400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 17, 2014&quot;}</td>

I didn&#39;t think I would ever sing praises to a garden hose, but here I am.  As someone with not particularly strong hands or wrists, I really appreciate the design of the hose coupler.  It is easy to grasp and I could turn it tightly enough not to leak without using pliers.  A big thank you to whoever came up with this design.  Another welcome feature is that the hose curls the way I want it to.  I keep it in a large pot, so I want a larger circle of hose and not the tight ring it came in.  It was so easy to place it neatly in the pot, and it willingly goes back into the new, looser curl.  The hose it replaced wanted to curl tightly, even after years of use, so it was always tangled.  I have four garden hoses, and this is by far my favorite.  Eventually I&#39;ll replace the other three with Scott&#39;s MaxFlex - it is the best garden hose I&#39;ve ever owned.Added 5/6/2014: I have learned that I need to carefully unwind this hose out of the pot.  If I simply pull it out of the pot as I walk across the yard, it will kink in multiple places.  It is still the best hose (by far) for curling into the pot, it lies flat and it never tangles, so I&#39;m not deducting stars for the kinks.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Ode to a Garden Hose&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395273600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 20, 2014&quot;}</td>

Where we are, we get mostly Broad-tail hummingbirds.  They tend to feed one at a time; if a second one shows up, they chase each other around until one leaves (for the time being).  The six feeding flowers may help hummingbirds find the food, but aren&#39;t used simultaneously by our birds.It is well made of sturdy plastic; the jar is especially thick clear plastic.  The jar is sealed at the top - to refill, unscrew the top and bottom, flip it over, clean, and pour in the solution.  Ours leaked the first day until we realized we needed to turn the flowers so the clips would hold them tighter - presto, no more leaks!  The perches can be removed if desired, but it is really cool to see hummingbirds perched - which they do about 1/3 the time when feeding.For the \&quot;nectar,\&quot; we dissolve 1/2 cup white sugar in 2 cups plain boiling water; be careful about adding anything else as it could be harmful to the hummingbirds.  This fills it about 1/3 way, which lasts several days even with lots of bird activity.  I don&#39;t want to let it go more than a few days between refills to ensure the solution doesn&#39;t spoil.  So really, something with less capacity would work just fine.  It doesn&#39;t leak (except for spillage when the wind blows it around), and the hummingbirds noticed it and began feeding within a few hours of putting it up.  The base has plenty of color to attract birds, so no need for red solution.Taking down the feeder for cleaning and refilling would be easier with a small clip.  We tied ours to a string and have to either work the top out of the wire hanger, or unscrew it and leave the top hanging, making it harder to reattach when full.  A clip would make this much easier.  Also be sure to let the solution cool completely before filling, and rinse off the perches when cleaning and refilling to encourage perching.We hung ours a few feet outside a picture window, and the hummingbirds don&#39;t seem to mind at all when we are nearby.  Perhaps they have gotten used to humans.  We can stand quietly just under the hanging feeder and they come in to feed without seeming to notice us.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Oversized and sturdy - twist flowers to stop leaks!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401840000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

It was a glass bottle version with wood ends and a plastic insert. Over the years, we tried other feeders but never found another that performed as well. We moved a few years ago and have not bothered to set up a feeder in our new place.This feeder is well constructed and attractive. It is glass with metal ends surrounding plastic threaded caps. It is easy to fill and clean. The old feeder required a long bottlebrush to clean, and even then it was difficult to keep the very top clean. This accommodates a larger brush and is easier to keep clean. It also holds a reasonable amount of liquid. Some people may think larger capacity is better, but it is preferable to refill and clean the feeder more often. In addition, hummingbirds are territorial, and it is unlikely that more than one will feed at a time.The nectar is easy to use: just add 8 ounces of water and mix. No boiling is required and the solution dissolved quickly. I will go back to my old water and sugar solution but I enjoyed trying the included sample packet.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Excellent Hummingbird Feeder&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401667200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

I am catching raccoons, and they enjoy, fish, crispy bacon, nuts and marshmallows.  The trap is a little tricky to set up.  Lift the metal gate and secure a small latch that connects to a slot in the door.I have a recommendation with regards to placement.  Because the floor is open, I recommend placing this on a piece of cement or plywood.  It will keep you from having to dig out a lot of dirt, which I have done.The trap is durable and will keep your critter secure.ConclusionI caught my first raccoon on the first night.

I deployed this slightly larger trap and within 2 days, we had a chipmunk. It was scared but unhurt (baited with peanut butter on crackers). We carried the critter to the far side of the street, across a small bridge. We have put the trap back in the garage and are waiting to see if the chipmunk returns or had a mate.Overall, this trap works well, sets up easily and doesn&#39;t hurt the trapped animal. It&#39;s a little tricky to get the animal out (wear gloves!!) but it can be done if you are careful. This is a job not recommended for children.Recommended if you have to catch a small (mouse, chipmunk) critter. Too small for a raccoon or possum.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Another winner from Havahart&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401321600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 29, 2014&quot;}</td>

In fact they can protect birds by keeping their nests away from dangerous areas.For the past few years birds have tried to nest in a hanging flower basket by my front door. The one year they succeeded and laid eggs, every time the door opened or someone came up on the porch they flew away in a panic, swinging the basket and in the process lost an egg. This wasn&#39;t too pleasant for any of the humans that got near it either. I also had birds try to nest in the rafters under my deck where they then panicked anytime someone stepped out on to it.These spikes solved that problem. I had previously been using plastic forks. These look better and are also more effective. I used a bolt cutter to snap the 10 foot spikes into smaller pieces that would fit into the under deck areas. They really did not break/snap into shorter lengths. I also used screws and an electric screwdriver to fasten them which was better than trying to drive nails. I put a small piece in my hanging basket and covered the base of it with potting soil after securing it with toothpicks.The result is the birds have found better places and the humans are happier too.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;For the birds&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398729600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 29, 2014&quot;}</td>

Lately there has been relatively significant traffic of moles under the soil in my yard. I have tried a wide variety of traps and poisons for moles, but not all of them have worked, but this one works if you follow the instructions correctly. I think some reviewers have expressed regrets over this product not working for them. The trick is that you have to plant these pellets where the pests can see, and generally in their traffic paths or tunnels actively used. I use a hard wooden stick or a metal rod to pierce a hole in the mound and detect the tunnel, and then drop a teaspoon full of pellets. Generally the holes are below the surface and the stick gives a reasonable measure of where the tunnel is. There are hits and misses, but you have to follow it up at least once a week to see if there is a new mounds in the yard. Apply there and wait for couple of days to see the results. Be persistent, it is a tiring procedure, but it works.On the lesser side of this mole \&quot;poison\&quot; is the product description on Amazon.com product page. It is a little confusing to read that this is a mild laxative and used for horses, cattle, sheep and dogs. Is this product (zinc phosphate) not poisonous? Then how is it killing moles and gophers? Why Zinc Phosphate is banned in the states of New Hampshire and North Carolina, if this Zinc Phosphate is the only active ingredient of this product?&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The product works but it must be applied inside the traffic tunnel&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401753600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

Chou \&quot;THE Savvy Consumer\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;The purpose of a lawn aerator is to treat dried, brown or troubled lawn areas in order for air, water, and fertilizer to reach and nourish the grass roots.  I&#39;ve used the Hound Dog brand of aerator for years with good results and  was eager to give this Yard Butler brand a try.Likes:*Coring aerators punches out a soil &amp;#34;plug&amp;#34; which is better than spike aerators that just pushes/compacts soil around the holes.*Simple to use, just step on the lower bar to aerate the soil and push out the plugs.  Logic dictates that placing the aerating tubes perpendicular to the lawn will result in less effort and plugs cleanly punched out.*T-handle for a good grip when lifting up the aerator.*Newer design with beveled, smaller diameter lower section of aerator tubes resulted in less plugs stuck inside.What I&#39;ve learned over the years of aerating lawns:*Only need to aerate dry, brown, troubled spots, NOT the entire lawn.*The soil need to be just right: Too damp, DON&#39;T need aerating, and the plugs will get stuck.  Too dry, aerating tubes can&#39;t punch through and the cutting edges are dulled. The solid needs to be just damp enough for the aerating tubes to punch through and cleanly push out the plugs.*The old Hound Dog aerator just has an unbreakable U-shaped handle, unlike the Yard Butler aerator which has a welded T-handle.  I&#39;m extra careful not to push down on the handle, and just lift the handle gently during removal from the soil.*Some damp plugs will get stuck occasionally, just push it out by stepping on some slightly damp soil.  I wouldn&#39;t use a screwdriver to pry out the plugs because that may roughen up the inner surfaces of the aerating tubes and cause more plugs to get stuck.*Just get a tube or stick that&#39;s slightly smaller in diameter than the aerating tubes and punch out the stuck plugs.*Be careful not to bend or distort the cutting edges will lead to more stuck plugs.Overall:Good for treating sections of troubled, brown, dried lawn.  For major, large lawn aerating, hire a pro or rent out a power tiller/aerator.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Effective core aerator for trouble lawn areas.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401580800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

The really great feature is that this holds 48oz of nectar.....enough to last more than a day!

A great product for so much entertainment in our outdoor space.**May 17, 2014  This update is an unhappy one! Our huge feeder now has a leak underneath, along the bottom of the base...what a mess!  We had it hanging in a tree and thought that the wind was causing the feeder to sway too much, losing all of the solution.  We decided to place it on a stable post to correct the problem...wrong!  The plastic base piece is open for easy cleaning, but actually consists of two attached pieces that do not make a good seal .  We are totally disappointed with Perky-Pet concerning this flaw in design.  Hopefully, the company will soon address this issue, and figure out a way to make a bottom piece that is solid. but easy to clean.  This also applies to the models that have two separate bottom pieces that Really Leak!

I had read a review of the unit before I ordered it about the threads in the stand being a problem. Yes they are a problem.  As I tried to put in the sprinkler that I had just purchased, I was very careful, I found that the sprinkler would not go in straight and the sprinkler end thread was being ruined. I looked at the threads in the Yard Butler and they were  clearly not tapped properly. If I would have continued it would have ruined my sprinkler head. It was not a question of lining them up, the Yard butler threads were bad.Since I have the tools and knowledge of threading  and tapping pipe, I re-did the Yard butler threads and it accepted the sprinkler and works fine. The problem is that most people who would buy this expect it to work without having to machine the unit to make it right.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Sprinkler stand&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398470400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

For the cons - you need to follow the directions for it to work properly, the water pressure is disappointing and it is rather fragile when compared to a &#39;normal&#39; hose. I&#39;ve found it&#39;s better for watering plants and washing the car rather than for running a sprinkler or connecting to the pressure washer.

The determinate plant (Container&#39;s Choice) is also very healthy appearing, I have about six visible tomatoes but I expect many more will be appearing soon at the same time as is typical for determinates. Of note the tomatoes that I have grown in normal pots have not done as well. The second box I planted cucumbers they have grown extremely quickly, not too much fruit yet although I think that is because I didn&#39;t not properly plan for a trellis. The last box I mixed a squash plant (I have already harvested 2 squash which was great), and peppers plants which have not grown that well but that is probably my fault since the squash plant has blocked sunlight.Overall impressed with the earthbox system, I was able to hook up a 1/4 inch drip irrigation tubing line to the fill holes of the Earthboxes, so twice a day they are filled automatically.

It safely and effectively saturates their food sources and surrounding areas, making it taste and smell unpleasant, consequently forcing them to relocate from your yard.I have not seen any moles or mole mounds since using this product.

I noticed the perky waterer seems very flimsy but I hung it up anyway.The waterer, in theory, will be filled by rain, but if I hang it in a tree the branches would interfere, plus, here in New Orleans, rain is usually accompanied by wind, so this would be flying around and spilling out instead of filling up.I saw a bird trying to land and drink and the waterer swung around like a carnival ride, the bird looked confused and so am I. This is so light weight and ever time it swings just a little water drips out this way and that. I have filled it four times since hanging it up yesterday.

While I&#39;m generally comfortable working with a variety of trees, shrubs, herbs, and flowers, I welcome knowledgeable advice. That&#39;s why I was eager to put this helpful Parrot to work.I&#39;ll focus here on showing how the Parrot works out of the box and what it&#39;s like tapping into the specific data you gather and augmenting your knowledge with the plant library the app provides. Thus far, the unit and app both seem to be working well (including the day I let my plant dry out to see whether that would trigger a \&quot;water me\&quot; alert, which it did).Since I \&quot;drive\&quot; the Parrot with my phone, I was able to snap some screen shots for you. I&#39;ve placed them, with annotations, in the customer images section on the product page.  These shots include live-action shots and historical data. The app archives data so that you can review in daily, weekly, and monthly view.  The Parrot unit gathers and stores data and transmits it via Bluetooth. The Flower Power app communicates with the \&quot;Parrot Cloud\&quot; by way of 3G, 4G or wifi.Setup is simple, but remind yourself that it takes at least 24 hours for the Parrot to generate its first report. In the meantime, you can dig into the Flower Power database, and start building your \&quot;garden,\&quot; by selecting other plants with which you will want to work. Each time your search nets a result, you can add that plant to your garden. You can personalize entries by taking photos of your plants, or use the images provided in the database. You have access to 6,000 plants.Be sure that the Flower Power app recognizes your physical location; this simple but necessary step helps with future use. Indeed, during initial use, I received notification that an update for my location (Hawaii) was available; depending on your location, you may receive a similar prompt.Speaking of locations, I am in Zone 10, which isn&#39;t ideal for some of the plants I would like to grow. However, I&#39;ve checked through the app and located support for several flowers I plan to grow this year, including particular varieties of crocus and tulips. In years past, I&#39;ve had varying results with these plants, so I hope that the Parrot will mean a better outcome this year.In order to make best use of the app, I would need to have multiple Parrot units. The workaround I&#39;ve been using is to move the Parrot from one plant to the next on a weekly basis. In several more months, I will evaluate the overall benefit of the Parrot unit and the Flower Power database, and decide whether to buy additional units.If you have questions about the unit or the app, please post in the comments, and I will respond as soon as possible.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Parrot on Patrol&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392854400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 20, 2014&quot;}</td>

This means that the feeder is pretty heavy and the metal is extraordinarily durable.  In fact, a number of the hoods and perches came knocked out of place during shipping.  (Amazon&#39;s usually amazing service for some reason did a lousy job with packing this item for shipment.)  But the perches and hoods were not damaged or bent despite what was probably a turbulent journey and they were easily snapped back into place.  I&#39;ve only had it for a month, but my guess is that the quality material will probably fare a lot better and longer than my other bird feeder which is mostly made of thin plastic.For what it is primarily designed to do, it does it just fine.  It&#39;s easy to fill with bird seed and it attracted a variety of beautiful birds the very first day.However, it is not squirrel proof.I actually filled both feeders and suspended this one from a tree using ametal hookand the other from ashepherd&#39;s hook.  I noticed the very first day that half the seed was gone, very quickly.  Suspicious that a squirrel was getting into them, I swapped the two feeders, thinking that perhaps the lack of a plate on the bottom of this Seed Bunker feeder would make it harder for the squirrel to get a grip onto the feeder from the shepherd&#39;s hook.  A few hours later, I saw that much of the seed was gone already.  And then an hour after that, I caught the culprit in the act.  The squirrel was able to climb right up the shepherd&#39;s crook and then held himself upside down while raiding the Seed Bunker.  It did the exact same thing with the other bird feeder by climbing the tree and scooting himself upside down the metal hook.  At this point, I&#39;m pretty convinced that very little will deter squirrels from the bird feeders, not even those fancy ones which have thecollapsible perches(designed to collapse at the heavy weight of a squirrel, but not a bird) since the squirrel made no use of the perches at all when he was lowering himself onto the feeders from above.It should be noted that Perky Pet does market a number of wild bird feeders that are specifically targeted for problem squirrelshere,here, andhereamong several others, but even those are of limited effectiveness against a determined squirrel.  (Which is what we&#39;ve got.  Those little buggers have completely chewed through several thick plastic trash can lids of ours.)  Squirrels can chew through plastic parts of so-called squirrel-proof bird feeders.  And even if the feeder is completely made of metal (which this Seed Bunker feeder is not, as the viewing windows are very thin plastic), the squirrels can learn to shake the feeder and spill the seed onto the ground.  There are a fewfeedersthat seem to fare better at warding off squirrels than the ones from Perky-Pet, but they tend to be inthe next price range upand still not 100% effective for everyone.Our current hope, since we don&#39;t contemplate spending more money on bird feeders, is that greasing the pole and hook with ample amounts of vaseline will keep the squirrels away and perhaps make for some funny videos if we see them slipping off.  We will see if that does the trick and I&#39;ll come back here and update.  I guess, meanwhile, the silver lining in all this is that now that the squirrels have all this bird seed, they&#39;re sorta leaving my trash cans alone.  The other silver lining is that my kids have a good reason to scream \&quot;Those Darn Squirrels!\&quot; whenever they see the thieves raiding the feeders.If you found this review helpful or if you have any questions, please let me know.

Jentsch&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;This is the third Perky Pet hummingbird feeder I&#39;ve tested, and it&#39;s my favorite. It&#39;s the most attractive, with a glass cylinder and a copper finish on the metal cap and the plastic base surround, with metal flowers surrounding the ports that are protected by what the company identifies as bee guards. We haven&#39;t hit the time of year when bees are a problem around our hummingbird feeders, so I can&#39;t attest to their effectiveness.The glass cylinder is quite narrow, so it will be difficult to clean without a bottle brush. I also suggest getting a small brush to clean the ports, as they are deep enough that you really want to make sure that they get clean. The base comes apart, so it&#39;s easy to clean, but the metal flowers will slow you down a little. It&#39;s worth it, though, since they add to the attractiveness of the feeder. I didn&#39;t have any trouble with leaking, which was reported in some other reviews.The hummingbirds seem to like this feeder the best as well. Of the three feeders (all cylinder-style), they have been most attracted to this feeder. They do seem to have some problem perching and eating at the same time. It&#39;s possible that the bee guards are impeding their ability to get to the juice while sitting on the perches, as they usually hover while feeding.As with the 30-ounce feeder, this feeder came with a packet of nectar concentrate. I recommend tossing it in the garbage, and make a fresh batch of nectar by using four parts boiled water to one part sugar. The packet contains red dye, which the company states is harmless to the birds, but it&#39;s not necessary to attract them, so why take the chance?This is a very attractive feeder and would make a great gift. While they are not nearly as attractive, I still prefer the dish-style feeders, like the Aspects Hummzinger feeders that are available here, and the similar Wild Birds Unlimited-branded feeders, but this is pretty good as well.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Attractive and functional feeder.

Scott&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;Update 6/13/2014: After initially saying he didn&#39;t really like this hose and would probably rarely, if ever, use it, my husband has totally changed his mind from when we first tried this hose.  I asked him what he thinks now, and he said, \&quot;Oh, my god, I love it!  You just have to get used to how you have to use it.  We should have gotten one of these years ago.\&quot;  And despite our initial impressions, this is now his go-to hose when he&#39;s using a sprinkler.  He&#39;s also really happy that you can adjust the spray to high pressure without needing an attachment (a feature he didn&#39;t think he needed at first but now regularly uses).Here&#39;s my original review:This hose will NOT replace all hose needs.  If you need a very lightweight hose for, say, watering planters near the faucet, this will work.  But that&#39;s about all it&#39;s good for.Pros:*It&#39;s shockingly light.*It does retract (sort of).Cons:*You will not get anywhere near a 50-foot reach with this thing.  30 is more like it.*The flow is VERY low.*It&#39;s impractical to use with any attachment (sprinkler, for example) because the end of the hose (and the attachment) whips around when you turn off the water.*Speaking of whipping around, make sure there are no kids, pets, plants, or anything breakable in the way of this hose or near the end when you turn off the faucet.  The hose is gonna whip &#39;em.*The hose doesn&#39;t seem very sturdy or durable.However, if you really want and/or need a lightweight hose, as long as you know what you are in for with this type of product, this is probably among the better ones.  But for our yard, it was really little more than a novelty.

I have another one that looks prettier than this one, but even so, this is not bad. I don&#39;t really see trying to use the top for a planter unless I use plants that are potted and have a saucer underneath.I haven&#39;t needed the &amp;#34;Built-In Overflow Management System&amp;#34; yet and I doubt that I&#39;ll use both spigots at the same time. However, having an upper one means I don&#39;t have to bend over very far when I just want to fill a watering can, and the lower one is best for watering with a hose (more pressure plus the barrel will furnish water even if only a quarter of the way full).The hardware appears to be well made. If this is your first rain barrel, consider placing it convenient to plants that are not easily reached by an existing spigot. Convenience means that you are less likely to neglect watering your plants. And if you are in a climate that gets low temperatures, don&#39;t forget to drain your barrel as winter approaches. It&#39;s best to drain it and then store it someplace where it&#39;s sheltered from extreme cold.The water that comes off your roof and through your gutters is not completely clean but it is good enough for plants. Many homeowners will find this to be a worthwhile investment.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Useful, fairly attractive&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398556800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 27, 2014&quot;}</td>

If you feed birds regularly, you know that having more than a few birds visiting your feeders daily will have you adding birdseed to the LARGEST of feeders on a regular basis. I love feeding birds and watching them out my windows, but they eat about one seed for every thirty they throw on the ground.While this feeder is well-built, simple to hang, clean, and fill, it&#39;s really for tiny birds, and for occasional feeding. If you have grackles or doves that visit your feeder, this feeder will be empty in a very short time. Definitely go for a larger feeder, if you can.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;overall&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">4.0</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;summary&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>a little too small<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;unixReviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-c1">1393804800</span>, <span class="pl-ent">&quot;reviewTime&quot;</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>03 3, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

This one definitely has more capacity than any other commercially available hummingbird feeder, which means trips to remove, clean and refill the feeder are less frequent. The feeder does not come fully assembled and it&#39;s a bit of a struggle to snap in those yellow floral discs... and because of the opening there is big (a huge invite for wasps, etc.) without the yellow disc, it&#39;s not an optional add-on - you&#39;ve got to snap that sucker in there... it just makes it more complex to take apart to clean. I make my own feeder mixture of 5:1 water to sugar ratio as the birds do not need red dye - the red on the feeder is enough to attract them. I prep the mixture in the kitchen after I clean my feeders, then fill the feeder - carrying it upside down until I get in the yard so there is minimal spillage. Even though this one was properly assembled, there was some spilling when I righted it - more than I&#39;m used to in a feeder. The central reservoir is plastic - likely because glass would make it too heavy - but I am not impressed with the quality of the plastic grooves you use to turn/lock this into place. Taking it apart and re-assembling it just once put little clear and red plastic shavings everywhere - including in the nectar reservoir. I do not see this lasting through an abundant number of refills - because those plastic tabs get shaved each time you screw and unscrew the bottom from the reservoir - eventually, it simply will not have the friction to stay together when too much material is lost. I know they&#39;re calling this &amp;#34;The Grand Master&amp;#34; because of the capacity - but I&#39;d much rather see a higher-quality one - glass reservoir with a metal bottom and baked enamel paint instead of this weak plastic that quickly wears. I have some high quality feeders I paid a lot of money for - because they are made out of such better materials and frankly -they look better. Perky-Pet did great on the capacity - I just wish they&#39;d done better on the materials end.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;large on volume - fewer refills required&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399507200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

Initially I did not think that this would work because for the first few or more days I did not see any results. However, eventually the Wet and Forget kicked in and as time passed the mildew and fungus were eliminated.The elimination is not a final result because the mildew and fungus will keep returning. Whenever I feel the slightest inkling that these unwelcome visitors may return I do a thorough spray down and my driveway and walkways remain clean of this nuisance.Using this product requires patience.

Keeping in mind that I&#39;m not a BBQ expert (and I&#39;ve never tried to grill veggies before), the results were pretty good.The sheets are a thin Teflon-based (PTFE-coated) pad that you toss on the BBQ to heat/roast/cook whatever you have in mind. I used it for veggies I had marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. You have to make sure the pad is not exposed to open flame, nor used in temps over 500 degrees. When I got done with the grilling (complete with sizzling marinade), the veggies were nicely singed and soft. It&#39;s a little hard to work with the sheet right off the grill, as there&#39;s no real structure or stiffness to it. I had to scoop most of the veggies off with a spatula before I could grab the corners and pour the rest of the marinade into the bowl. Washing was a little strange (hand-washing), as it was hard to scrub it down to make it feel completely clean. On the next pass, I&#39;ll probably run it through the dishwasher.The skewers were a bit more iffy for me. It was better for larger chunks, as the &amp;#34;sharp end&amp;#34; is more blunt than the typical wooden skewers. I liked how you can shape the skewer around the grill based on the flexibility of the wire. I had to be careful when moving them around, as they *do* conduct heat better than wood. I also had to remove the food from the skewer before serving, as a looping wire doesn&#39;t quite have the same visual pizazz as individual wooden skewers.I&#39;ll definitely be adding more grilled veggies into my routine by using the TeiKis mats. I&#39;m not sure how much I&#39;ll use the skewers, but I still like the idea of having them around if needed.Disclosure:Obtained From: RetailerPayment: Free&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;For a BBQ novice, this worked out pretty well...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402358400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 10, 2014&quot;}</td>

The iron content helps the leaves stay nice and green, and they are growing much faster than when I&#39;ve not used it.  (I used Jungle Grow/Hyponex, instead of the more expensive potting soils that already have fertilizer in them to test this in my greenhouse- and this is really just as good.)I&#39;ve also used this on pansy seedlings, in pansy seed starter mix, on full grown pansies, petunias, dianthus, and marigolds, and it really seems to encourage healthy plants and abundant, blooming.  I saw an increase in blooms just a few days after application.  I like to apply mine right before I know it will rain.  Wait 2-3 days, boom- Flower bomb!The extra nitrogen boost really helps keep flowers on the plants.I&#39;ve also used this on very young cucumber and tomato plants, and they both seemed to like it, with vigorous plant growth.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Good value - extended feeding&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399075200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

The 3200 model is the premier model in the line of 5 Q series grills, with all the others being a &amp;#34;Tabletop&amp;#34; version. The 3200 is similar to the 2000 versions however it comes with a stand. At first I was a little disappointed that this was plastic. Being used to the build quality of the Genesis series I was surprised.... however it quickly became apparent that my concerns were not warranted and this is a smart design choice by Weber. The use of a heavy duty plastic results in a dramatic reduction in weight without a loss of it feeling solid. I was able to put the unit together in under an hour without any assistance. The documentation is clear and the instructions guided me through to completion without issue. The grill is well designed, as with all Weber grills I have owned or used, the attention to detail shows the quality of this grill. The built in handle light is a nice addition which I had purchased for the genesis, this comes included with the 3200. The side tables fold down and click back together with a substantial lock. The design of the grill plate is clever, the cast porcelain coated plates actually incorporate a flavorizer bar just below the grill bars allowing for a much more compact unit without sacrificing the key functions of the bigger grills in the Weber family.The lid is aluminum coated to reduce the weight of the unit, which can easily be lifted by two people without any strain (one could do it in a pinch). I was able to roll this around with one hand. Ideal for throwing on a truck for tailgating before the game and with the tables folding down the footprint for transporting is not too big. Weber&#39;s standard drip tray is also incorporated with the unit meaning standard parts can be purchased for use. There is incorporated holder for the propane tank - electric ignition and dual burners - one outside ring and a central burner from left to right this allows for configuration of indirect heat if required.Again you are getting Weber&#39;s quality and from my understanding their warranty service is outstanding - I have never had to utilize it though, their products have served me that well in the past. Due to the winter weather this has seen very limited use but as soon as it warms up a bit I look forward to lighting this baby up some more!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Bring On the Tailgating!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393459200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 27, 2014&quot;}</td>

They are less likely to catch your finger instead of the mouse. One thing I especially like about these is the trigger, it is larger than most. So the mouse is more likely to set off the trap. The plastic actually smells like cheese, so you can put it out without bait ans still catch a mouse. Personally, I use peanut butter with a touch of bird seed to bait my traps.

This bag contained one refillable bait station and 8 baits. The station was wrapped in plastic while the baits were unwrapped and so freely moved around inside the bag. It would have made more sense to bundle the baits together in plastic-wrap. As it was, some of the baits had chipped corners and other minor damage. Plus you have to touch (with gloves) a poison-coated plastic wrap to unwrap the station. Just a \&quot;what were they thinking\&quot; comment. You have to touch the bait (with gloves) to load the station, anyway, so it&#39;s not a big deal.The station is not difficult to load, though it does require human fingers. The station is CHILD and DOG resistant to tampering. The plastic bait station is sturdy-looking. The bait is not easily accessible unless you&#39;re a mouse, break the trap, or know how to open the station for refilling. Crumbs of nibbled bait could fall out if \&quot;rattled\&quot; for a bit, though. I don&#39;t put poison traps anywhere a pet or child could easily get at them (or the dead mice), but these traps probably would slow children or dogs down long enough for someone to notice and stop them before the bait was touched.You can view the state of the bait (nibbled? gone?) through the clear plastic top so you know when to add a new bait or if you should try a new location. The traps are weather-resistant and can be used INDOORS and OUTDOORS. I&#39;ve left mine outside fully exposed to the heavy rains we&#39;ve been having the last few days, and so far the bait is still dry. It&#39;s also shown signs of some nibbling. There is a tunnel that protects the station&#39;s entrance from rain. The traps are 4.25\&quot; x 4.25\&quot; x 1.25\&quot;. They clearly are for mice, not larger rodents.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;1 refillable outdoor/indoor bait station for house mice (plus 8 baits included)&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401321600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 29, 2014&quot;}</td>

So call this preliminary, and if I run into any unexpected problems, I&#39;ll be back to update my review.The one thing about this, like other Miracle Gro products that puts me off is price.

I can see from the top how active mice have been at each station. Every station I have set has had significant action. The poison works quickly. I have actually had two mice die at the station. One thing to be aware of is the active ingredient kills mice but the mice don&#39;t have that dead mouse smell. I think this is a huge plus.

Maybe if you have bermuda or some other variety it might do the trick for tiny yards.As a weed whacker, again, I have to say it is so so.  This is a lightweight yard tool - the batteries are small and it really feels under-powered to me, but I am used to using a 36volt li-ion trimmer that can go thru absolutely anything i throw it at.  For the first edging of the season, you&#39;ll have a really hard time getting a nice clean line with this tool. This tool, while a clever design, is really only suitable for small yards that are consistently maintained.  The only thing I can really say that I like about it, is the edger guide, which goes against the sidewalk to guide not just placement, but also depth, the guide has a little bump out that sits on top of the sidewalk so that you aren&#39;t going down too deep and wasting a bunch of trimmer line.I have always like black and decker yard products because they are light enough and sized appropriately for a small woman to do her own yard work - a big plus in my book, and this tool is no exception. However, putting the guard on during first assembly out of the box was unreasonably difficult - I couldn&#39;t get it to snap into place no matter how hard I pushed.  I had to wait for my husband to get home and get him to do it.  Big fail.  Why should it  be so difficult to put together that I have to ask my husband for help?Once you get past that difficulty, the rest of this product is dead simple to use and nice and lightweight. I just wish it had a little more power, and I wish it would have come with one longer lasting battery as opposed to two small ones.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;okay as a lght duty weed whacker/edger, not really suitable as a mower&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399593600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

Not bad, just a little weird at first, although I definitely wouldn&#39;t want it open if the wind was any higher.  I went in for a while with the umbrella still up.  When I came out again later with a step stool to lower it, the umbrella was still expanded, but the arm was no longer locked in the upright position and had slid all the way down.  I&#39;m assuming all of the bouncing around from the wind caused it to unlock.

So years ago I switched to a Toro electric blower, which is zero maintenance; but dealing with a 100&#39; cord is a real hassle.  So, when I saw this GreenWorks battery-powered leafblower, I had high hopes, especially since I&#39;ve been very happy with my GreenWorks G-MAX lawnmower.The blower is great for weekly cleanup.  It&#39;s lighter than I expected and produces a very strong air stream -- at least as powerful as my Toro AC powered blower that has the same MPH rating.  The speed control can be easily dialed up and down with your thumb while using the tool, so you can continuously adjust the blower to get just the right force.  Very convenient and easy to use.  I find myself using this blower ten times more often than my old blower, simply because its so simple and convenient.  It takes three seconds (literally) to grab a battery off the shelf, snap it into the blower, and get to work.The only downside of the blower (which almost caused me to drop the rating down to four stars) is that the battery only lasts about 15-20 minutes.  My GreenWorks G-MAX lawn mower runs twice as long on a single battery, so I was expecting better battery life.  The 15-20 minute run time is fine for weekly cleanups, but it means this leafblower won&#39;t be able to replace my other leafblower for fall cleanup, when I typically have to run the blower for over an hour to move mountains of fallen leaves.Bottom line:  I really like this blower for weekly cleanup.  It&#39;s lightweight, powerful, and super convenient.  It starts instantly and creates no fumes, so I tend to use it a lot more often.  It won&#39;t do hour-long leaf clearing sessions in the fall, but it&#39;s a great yard tool, especially if you own other GreenWorks G-MAX tools, since the batteries are fully interchangeable.  (Buying into the GreenWorks system of 40V G-MAX lawn tools is sort of like buying into Dewalt 18V tools.  The convenience of interchangeable batteries is huge.  I own three different GreenWorks tools and have become a huge fan of their system.)&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great for weekly (but not extended) cleanup&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399852800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 12, 2014&quot;}</td>

It is very fast at getting a read. You can press the \&quot;hold\&quot; button to fix it at the temperature while it&#39;s inserted, so that when you bring it closer to read it, the reading won&#39;t change as it cools down.For some reason, when it arrived it was \&quot;stuck\&quot; and wouldn&#39;t turn off or on. Removing the battery and then putting it back in reset it, and it&#39;s worked just fine ever since then.

Cleaning requires unscrewing the top and bottom from a clear glass tube and hand washing with warm soapy water twice a week.  Then screw the feeder base with bee guards onto the glass tube, add up to 12 oz/355 ml nectar, screw the top on, and hang the feeder in an easily visible area.The Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder is the first feeder I&#39;ve owned or attempted to use.  After a month, I&#39;ve yet to see a hummingbird and the nectar level hasn&#39;t changed.  A week in and I started to wonder what I was doing wrong.  Between Perky Pet&#39;s companion website and some advice from friends, I learned that hummingbirds are territorial, have poor eyesight, and are attracted to bright red and orange colors.  Perky Pet&#39;s interactive hummingbird migration map also verified sightings in my area.  After learning this, I started looking at plants for the yard which might help attract hummingbirds and relocated the feeder from a secluded area off the back porch to a more visible spot outside my kitchen window.Even though I&#39;ve yet to feed a hummingbird, I can&#39;t blame the Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder.  This feeder is simple to clean, fill, and maintain, not to mention easy on the eyes.  If you&#39;re looking for a stylish hummingbird feeder, I highly recommend the Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder.PROS:Simple to clean and fillBee guards protect nectar from bees and wasps12 month limited warrantyCONS:None I could find&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Stylish Simplicity: A Perky-Pet 710B Elegant Copper Glass Hummingbird Feeder with Free Nectar Review&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401408000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

Here in Arizona, hoses usually rot within a year or two (the intense heat and sun kills them), but I am cautiously optimistic about this one.  It works great - I can pick it up, extend to the areas I need to water, and then it all very neatly and tightly coils back together near my spigot.  I think the straight ends are KEY as the other coil hoses I&#39;ve had didn&#39;t have this.  As some of the other reviewers noted, you cannot cover anywhere near 50&#39; of distance with this hose due to the coils and the inability to stretch the hose out flat.  Mine works optimally in a 15-25&#39; range and after that I need to hold one side of it with tension to allow the hose to stretch more, maybe to around 35&#39; of range.  I&#39;m very careful not to stretch the coils more than they are intended because when you do that, they can reverse on themselves and it makes untangling the hose a nightmare.  I&#39;ll update this review when the hose fails so if there&#39;s no additional note, it&#39;s still going strong!UPDATE:  4 months in and this hose is still going strong.  I am impressed with it&#39;s ability to recoil just as tightly as it was when I received it on day 1.  Looks great underneath my spigot.

In about 4\&quot; of snow, the snowblower did well. It got right down to the asphalt in my driveway, and concrete sidewalk. It&#39;s not nearly as loud as my neighbor&#39;s Toro snow shovel, so I don&#39;t imagine that I annoyed anyone using this in the morning, either. Installation was a piece of cake, and I used Loctite Blue on some of the screws, after reading previous reviews, so that I didn&#39;t have any issues with anything coming loose. On top of that, I used WD40 inside the deck, on the auger, and inside the shoot (you MUST let it dry first) - that, too, worked very well.I really only have two issues with this snowblower, and one of them plagues ALL electric snowblowers. First, cable management sucks. This is not a knock on this snowblower, but on all of them. Dragging around a 15lb., 100&#39; 12/3 cable can be a real PITA, and does make clearing snow take a little longer. Still beats the hell out of shoveling, though. Secondly, the chute doesn&#39;t always stay where you aim it. I had to turn it a few times after the snow started hitting it so hard that it would spin and throw snow in a different direction. This is the only reason I&#39;m giving this snowblower 4 stars instead of 5, and for the price that I paid, I may even be a little harsh in doing so. I&#39;ll likely come up with some solution to both issues, but the second one really should come from the factory.I&#39;ll likely update this review once we get more snow to see how things go, but once you get the hang of how you&#39;re going to attack your snow removal, things become easier (i.e., cable management). It&#39;s easy to see why this is the #1 rated electric snowblower on Amazon.-----------------------------------------------Update: 2/4/14-----------------------------------------------Our area was hit with 10-12\&quot; of some of the heaviest, wettest snow I&#39;ve ever dealt with, so I figured this was a great test for the snowblower. The snowblower handled most of the snow very well, and the only real time I had some issues, where I had to go over the same spot twice, was where my wife had previously driven over the snow and compacted it down. Still, I was able to clear everything down to the asphalt without much physical effort.I am still very impressed by how well this is handling a wide range of snow types. For those complaining about the snowblower not throwing the snow very far, that&#39;s going to happen if you&#39;re only trying to remove 2-3\&quot; of snow. The more snow you go through, the farther it&#39;s going to be thrown. This happens to all snowblowers, regardless of their powertrain (happened on our old neighborhood&#39;s $3k Honda, too).The chute issue does add some time to snow removal, since I have to constantly adjust it. I tried using a long velcro tie to keep it locked, but it was difficult to do quickly while wearing winter gloves. I&#39;m not sure why I didn&#39;t think of it sooner, but I&#39;m going to try using a very short bungee tie to keep it in place. If you attach it just below the chute handle before the rod bend, and attach to the side handlebars, it will keep the chute in place. A minor inconvenience, IMO, given that this steal beats the tar out of shoveling.

The gloves I&amp;#8217;ve been using were fabric that was coated with a heat resistant material. They worked, but the safe temp limit was about 200 degrees, which meant while I could pick up food with them, I could not use them as general heat protection mitts.These, however, are made of silicone and have a far higher temp resistance while still making it possible to use them to pick up food. They do have some quirks &amp;#8211; the silicone is sticky, which can make it a bit tricky to get them on your hands. But, a little finger wiggling and stretching the silicone gets the job done. They are also short &amp;#8211; they don&amp;#8217;t go past my wrist. A longer extension would be a useful addition.Finger and hand mobility with them on is decent. They are more than limber enough to allow me to pick up not only food, but roasts and kitchen tools. Cleanup is simple &amp;#8211; with the gloves on, drizzle some dish detergent and then wash your &amp;#8220;hands&amp;#8221; under water. Quick and easy!These would be perfect if they had a cloth liner to make it easier to put on, and an extension cuff (also fabric) to protect forearms from spatters. But, even as-is, I&amp;#8217;m finding these to be very useful and handy to have not only for BBQ/smoker use, but also for general kitchen tasks.

Thus far, the birds are just getting acquainted with the Stokes Double Suet Feeder.  I notice a winged patron on occasion (to my excessive delight), but can&amp;#8217;t say that it is well-frequented thus far.  Most prefer the other feeders yet.  If / when a little one is located in the double suet feeder, the feathered friend appears to pick away comfortably and seemingly relatively relaxed.

When I use hot pads, I sometimes get burns from oven racks as I&#39;m taking something out of the oven; when I use thick oven mitts, I don&#39;t have good control for handling pie dishes, muffin pans, or anything else with semi-liquid contents.These heat-resistant gloves made of knitted fabric allow me to use all five fingers (like thick knitted winter gloves) to handle pans or dishes.  The red silicone bands atop the fabric have the feel of rubber, and grip firmly (like rubber).  I can&#39;t vouch for the heat resistance up to 662 degrees F., but I do know that the gloves work well when I bake bread in a 465-degree oven, or broil in a 550-degree oven.A nice feature is that one size fits all.  The gloves are a fairly snug fit for my large hands (men&#39;s size small), but they seem to have enough remaining stretch to accommodate even larger hands.  The gloves have the same silicone bands on both sides--thus either glove will fit either hand.  There&#39;s never any need to locate the \&quot;left\&quot; or \&quot;right\&quot; glove if you&#39;re in a hurry.  The gloves are machine washable, but should be laid out flat to air dry.The accompanying literature includes the following warning:  \&quot;Do not use the glove when wet.  It loses its heat-resistant properties.  Do not use on oily, greasy or wet surfaces.  Do not expose the glove to open fire.  Even though the aramid fibers protect the glove from catching on fire, to prong its life and prevent any accidents, keep it away from fire.  Do not let small children use the glove to play with fire.\&quot;Disclaimer note:  This review is based on a product supplied to me free of charge for review purposes.

They provide nylon lined lock nuts and they are very difficult to turn. You will need a 15/16\&quot; wrench, make that two wrenches because you need to use so much force to thread the nylon lining you have to hold on to the bolt as you twist the nut. Other than that it went smoothly and the tires came inflated.The water supply hose provided is low quality 5/8\&quot; hose and a washer was not included for the end that connects to the hose reel. Fortunately I keep some on hand and did use a washer for that connection.The fitting on the reel the supply hose attaches to was screwed on so tight I had to use a wrench to back it off enough to attach the hose.The hose unwinds and winds easily and the unit is easy to move around. So far no leaks at the connectors.At 30 days I already have a couple spots of rust forming. The paint does not seem like a high quality baked on enamel and the U shaped piece in front of the wheels does not have any type of feet so the metal makes direct contact with the ground. It will likely get scratched up and be another source of rusting.The real test of a hose reel is how it is holding up after a season or two.  I am required to post a review within 30 days so I can only give first impressions and will follow up the review when I have had more time with it. My initial impression is this reel will last about as long as a good quality plastic hose reel (3 years) but it is twice the cost.In comparison; June 2004 I purchased a Rapid Reel two-wheeled all metal hose cart and it is still in service today. No rust, no parts have needed replacing and it came with a high quality 3/4\&quot; water supply hose. It has survived 9 Minnesota winters outside; I just disconnect the hoses and drain the water out. The Rapid Reels are very expensive but you don&#39;t have to replace them every three years.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;No way will this hold 175 feet of 5/8\&quot; hose&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401840000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

I purchased this 1025 and put it in the attic. The first night I caught a flying squirrel and it could not escape. Worked very well at holding him for a few hours till I could relocate it. The next night, I caught another flying squirrels. Two nights, two flying squirrels.

But read on because I also found a good use for it.First, let me tell you how to prevent squirrels in your feeders 100-percent of the time. I&#39;ve been feeding birds for decades (I&#39;m not going to say how many decades, lol) and while I have tons of gray squirrels on my property, none of them get to my feeders unless I want them to get there (and I do allow them to get to one of my tray feeders, particularly in cold winters). Squirrels can only jump approximately four vertical feet and a little more than that horizontally. So, if you go to a bird-feeder/wildlife supplies store, or your local home store, and buy a say, 8&#39; of metal piping and plant it in the ground (bird feeder stores, if you have one nearby, have a cool tool for this that makes the job ultra easy), you can place a baffle on the pipe just over four feet off the ground and the squirrels will *not* get past it. Then you can put a double or triple shepherd&#39;s hook at the top and hang several feeders. I have a 2&#39; x 2&#39; open tray feeder on another pole filled to the brim and no squirrel has ever feasted there. So what you need is a pole, a baffle and some kind of hooks at the top for hanging feeders: all of this is available in a bird-feeding store (I won&#39;t mention the chain name here because Amazon will take it out--but it has \&quot;wild\&quot; in the name). (Squirrels *can* jump downward amazing heights, by the way, so you must be careful not to be under a tree limb--I&#39;ve seen squirrels drop 20 feet vertically.)As far as this feeder goes. First of all, the dome is great for keeping the birds and seed a bit dryer, but it&#39;s not going to deter any squirrels. Five mins after the first squirrel got onto this feeder (and I hung it under a tree limb so that he could get there), he hung by his back paws from the loop and swung himself down. Mission accomplished.Also, the description says this hold 3.5 lbs of seed--hah, in someone&#39;s dreams. This hardly holds anything. A half pound if you&#39;re lucky. The feeder tray is only 9.5-inches across and less than an inch deep.OK, all of that said, there are uses for this feeder and, as I said, it&#39;s a cute feeder, pretty nicely made. As at least one other reviewer stated this make a good thistle (niger) feeder--excellent, in fact (some seed does drip out the drain holes, but that can&#39;t be avoided). But small finches do have trouble getting their beaks through the grating, so I removed it. I just fill the tray with thistle and they sit on the edge and it works just fine.In it&#39;s own way, I kind of find the feeder useful, now the goldfinches have their own little feeder and since squirrels don&#39;t like that type of seed, the barely pay it any mind. This feeder is not what it says it is, it&#39;s not a squirrel warrior, but it&#39;s kind of pretty and I&#39;m sure you can find uses for it. Ironically, if you took off the dome and got rid of the grid, you could fill it with peanuts and feed the squirrels. Or, if you have fruit-eating birds like Baltimore Orioles, you can place orange sections in it. Nothing beats seeing an Oriole at the feeder! If you want to buy the best bird feeders around, look at Droll Yankee. I&#39;ve probably spent a thousand dollars on feeders over the years and theirs last forever.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;It is not going to keep squirrels out but could be adapted for other uses&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396656000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 5, 2014&quot;}</td>

I recently saw the TOMCAT Mouse Attractant Gel and it seemed like a possible substitute for my time-tested favorite. This TOMCAT product is manufactured by Motomco in Madison, Wisconsin, only a two-hour drive from where we live. It comes premixed and ready to use in a 1-ounce (net weight) plastic squeeze bottle and you only need a small, pencil eraser-sized amount to bait a trap. It can be used with equal effectiveness in the vintage wooden traps, plastic snap traps and a variety of live traps.The following promise appears on the TOMCAT Mouse Attractant Gel packaging:\&quot;TOMCAT Mouse Attractant can enhance the effectiveness of any mechanical trap. It has a desirable, gel-like consistency and `no-mess&#39; spout making it the ideal alternative to cheese or peanut butter. PLUS, its taste is irresistible to mice and rats while being non-toxic to children and pets.\&quot;Better than peanut butter! After putting this mouse attractant to the test against peanut butter on a small piece of cracker I came up with the following results: (1) The TOMCAT was easier and less messy to apply and (2) both baits were equally effective at attracting mice.Any bait that can match the effectiveness of peanut butter is a product I can recommend.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;TOMCAT Mouse Attractant Gel&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398211200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 23, 2014&quot;}</td>

And because it casts such a wide and bright beam of light, after you are done grilling, you could swivel it around to help illuminate your sitting area. You could also attach it to a patio umbrella or stair railing, or even a tree branch ,and use it that way to light up another area.This little light packs some power, and it only uses 3 AA batteries, which were not included.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Night Grilling Made Easy&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403568000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 24, 2014&quot;}</td>

The brush is designed with stainless steel bristles for deep cleaning and a easy grip plastic handle, great for use on charcoal or gas grills.The easiest way to use this brush is on a hot grill with a good amount of water on the brush.  A little elbow grease makes the job go by quicker, though the manufacturer does suggest you not apply too much pressure else the brush might get caught in the grates.  It&#39;s far easier just to clean one side of the grates, then flip it over and do the other side.  I had my grill done in less than 10 minutes.  The brush cleans up in warm water and mine was in like new quality after doing so, really impressive.Overall, I&#39;m quite pleased with this grill brush by Alpha Grillers.

But the Yard Butler hose cart was a challenge. It does not have a lot of parts but there are NO instructions, just drawings, which are no help and are even numbered incorrectly should you decide to follow them.The first step is to attach the tires using a very large bolt and lock nuts. Simple, except that I could not tighten the lock nuts and wasn&#39;t sure how far in to tighten them even if I could. Leaving them at the point where they reached the plastic resulted in too much wobble. So I had to wait for my husband who is much stronger than me, had the correct, large wrench in his mechanic&#39;s toolbox, and knew just how much to tighten the bolts. And it required quite a bit of force to do so.Once we got the wheels installed it was easy going to attach the reel and the handle using a screwdriver. Next problem, the cart didn&#39;t roll very well. This is because the pneumatic tires had to be inflated. I think plastic tires would be just as good and not need to have air added periodically, especially after the winter. At the very least they could have shipped them with air. We have an air compressor, but not everyone has a tire pump or compressor.I connected the hose, turned on the water, and no leaks. My 100 foot hose fits on the reel, but there isn&#39;t enough room for a second hose. Now that it&#39;s assembled and operational, it looks nice and is much sturdier than the old plastic cart it replaced. So far, it&#39;s working as expected. Time will tell if it will hold up long term.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Assembly a bit of a challenge&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401667200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

We tried the little ant bait thing a few times in the past, you know, the things that look like modernistic little ant houses with little doorways around the edges. They seemed not to be to the taste of our picky little red ants (the kind that smell kind of like turpentine if you squish one). They always seem to be attracted to this stuff. With this product you can put out as many drops as you figure you need or follow the instructions and put a couple of drops on a piece of coated cardboard which is in the box. I use a small plastic can lid with low sides. I use about half a teaspoon or more. I place it in an area that isn&#39;t accessible to our pets, like in the far corner of the cupboard beneath the sink, with lots of bottles and things in front of it.After an hour or so there are hundreds of ants eating the stuff and carrying it back to the nest. Usually one day is all it takes. Occasionally a second application is needed. The ants just totally disappear. It&#39;s usually a couple months before they find their way back in, but we&#39;re always prepared with Terro.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I just ordered again&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402358400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 10, 2014&quot;}</td>

It&#39;s a self-feeding string and this has worked flawlessly.  It&#39;s nice not to have to stop and tap, or pull out string when it gets stuck, or any of the other pain in the neck string problems you get with other weed eaters.  The batteries last about 20 minutes, and when they&#39;re out of juice they stop all at once.  We have other equipment that uses the same lithium battery so I have 4 of them.  It takes 3 batteries to do my entire yard.  They recharge in about 6 hours.As for the string, I buy the pre-strung spools at Lowes.  One could probably just buy the string and rewind the spool if one had the time and inclination.  I don&#39;t.

I was so excited when I received this product that I immediately looked online for marinade recipes. There were so many I saw, but found a yummy sounding marinade recipe for pork. Since I was going to marinate the pork overnight, I found it easier to put the pork in a freezer bag right away and then started using the injector. I was really surprised how easy the injector was to use, and it was extremely sturdy too. Once the pork was done, it was the most moist and tender pork I&#39;ve ever had, and the pork tasted so delicious! I can&#39;t wait to try other marinades to use this injector with. Next meat I will try will be a turkey!I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated for this review in any way.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;So easy to use!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397001600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

This year it seems that the creature has developed a taste for squash leaves and has pulled the plants right our of the ground.Last year, I had the most success with liberal amounts of cayenne pepper as long as it didn&#39;t rain too much.  I also put a cayaenne and cat poop down its 2 tunnels that came by next to my vegetable patch.  But what really chased it off was my neighbour&#39;s 2 dogs.I have applied this repellent on 1 entrance and the liquid version offered by the same manufacturer on the 2nd entrance.  These seem to be more weatherproof than the cayenne and so far after 3 weeks I have not seen any additional damage to my growing vegetables.I will report back if anything changes for better or worse.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;So far so good.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403740800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

We have a large yard and our sprinklers do not cover everything perfectly.  To reach the farthest corners of our yard we need 150 feet of hose.  To cover that with this hose we&#39;d need  6 hoses (3 for the front and 3 for the back).  That&#39;s rather expensive.  But 150 feet of regular hose is soooo heavy.  What we do is use 100 feet of regular hose and then put one of these expanding hoses on the end and that works as most of the weight you are lugging around is the final 50 feet.  because of the solid brass fittings we readily change sprayers as needed.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great if you need a light hose&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397779200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

Finally, my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this, and I&#39;m glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands, it hasn&#39;t stuck or jammed, and they feel like they&#39;re made to last.

I&#39;ve been using this product for so long I can&#39;t count the years.  When this one arrived, I compared it to the older two spray nozzles (which still work after a LOT of use):  This is the same as what I bought last year--not a single difference that I can see.  Does the fertilizer do its job?  Oh, my, yes!  And I surely wouldn&#39;t be a long-time user and supporter of this Miracle-Gro fertilizer if it didn&#39;t give me great results.Plus, it is so easy to use and convenient!  I use the general purpose for all the flowers, green plants and herbs.  Then I switch out the all-purpose bottle with the bottle developed specifically for vegetables for the veggie gardens.  For my very delicate maidenhair ferns and my non-flowering orchids, I screw the spoon attachment onto the (all-purpose) bottle instead of the nozzle and I use a weaker solution in a watering can.  (You squirt fertilizer from the bottle into the attached spoon (it has measurement lines), tip the spoonful into your watering can and go again.)Now, if you have a many-years-old model, there are differences; or if you&#39;ve never used this product before, here&#39;s the scoop:  There are four spray configurations from which to choose; the turn knob at the top (for plain water / off / water-fertilizer mix) is easier to get a grip on and easier to turn; the handle is ergonomically correct, with on / off button easy to manipulate.  The bottle of liquid fertilizer (comes with one bottle) screws into the yellow end, so the nozzle as a whole looks a bit odd, but it is trying to do a balancing act with the bottle of fertilizer.Regarding the four spray choices:  The \&quot;shower\&quot; gives a good, general coverage--not too wide, not too heavy/harsh.  The \&quot;flat\&quot; works very well for me when it is very windy, or when I have plants close together in a line.  The \&quot;stream\&quot; is the configuration with all the tiny holes in the round; it also works for me when it is windy, or when I want to reach plants further away, as it is a more forceful spray.  The other one is \&quot;jet\&quot;, and I don&#39;t use that much at all, because it really disturbs the soil around the base of the plant and is forceful enough to make a mess of flower petals.  But I suppose the jet spray is good for shooting into a container.If you&#39;ve not used this product before, you should check on the price of replacement feeder bottles to see if it is in line with your budget:  You do pay for convenience!  If you&#39;ve got a good-sized garden, you will go through many bottles of this fertilizer if you fertilize as often as the directions recommend.  I fertilize about once every two weeks.  So, once every two weeks, I switch out the nozzle heads on my hose and use this, then I water and fertilize at the same time.  Whalla!  And done!(I have tried to use this nozzle as my everyday nozzle, (because you can turn the knob on top to water only) but I think it is a bit too heavy and cumbersome for constant use.)One tip:  After fertilizing, switch the knob to water only and spray for a short minute to clear the insides of fertilizer solution, in an effort to prevent corrosion.  Happy gardening!This kit comes in a plastic \&quot;stand\&quot;, with a hole for one bottle, the spoon and the nozzle.  I think it is a waste of plastic, and I don&#39;t think it adds value to the product.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Same feeder spray nozzle as last year; solution works wonders!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393632000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

The shaft on this Oregon trimmer is longer than that of the B&amp;D trimmer and the battery assembly on the back balances the weight of the trimmer at the other end, which reduces fatigue. The trim line is a durable cable, which requires less fuss and replacement than the plastic line of the B&amp;D trimmer. I find the power to comparable to a gas trimmer.

But one benefit from having the extender separate from the hose holder is that I don&#39;t have to worry about the weight of the coiled hose tipping it nor will I have any issue accessing its spigot through the coils of a hose hanging over it.The unit goes into the ground pretty easily (I used a small sledge hammer on the support leg) and sinks far enough down to make it very sturdy.  It is a hollow square shape that allows dirt to fill in the middle of the buried part as you sink it.  You get better purchase in the ground than with a single rod structure.  Both my extender hose and regular hose attached with no leaks.  That&#39;s especially key with the extender hose since the spigot at the house is always on so you are counting on this unit to stop the flow when not in use.I had such an arrangement in the past but the extender was very low to the ground, where this one is about 18&amp;#34; out of the ground and an easy height to access.  Its color is muted and blends in with the shrubbery so doesn&#39;t attract attention.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Sturdy, no leaks&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398816000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

I bumped the machine on the ground several times before convincing myself to use the switch to extend the string.This is a good trimmer that offers excellent performance; however, it may not be the trimmer I use personally because it is heavier than my old trimmer.  I am much smaller than the average American, and adding extra weight to the trimmer means, for me, that the machine is more difficult to control and that I tire much more quickly when using the trimmer.For small folk, this may not be the trimmer you want.

I was delighted to see that Havahart has a trap designed for smaller critters.This trap is about the size of a 12 pack refrigerator box of sodas. It features two doors and an easy set lever on top of the trap. My very favorite thing about this trap is the large metal plate under the carrying handle. Not all traps have this and I&#39;ve had some scary experiences trying to carry a trap with a raccoon in it, desperately trying to scratch and bite my hand through the wire under the carrying handle. This plate offers a lot of welcome protection for your hand, although I advise always wearing a thick leather glove when near any trapped animal.Depending upon what size creature you&#39;re trying to trap, you&#39;ll need to experiment with bait and whether or not to use one or two open doors. The mechanism for shutting the doors depends upon the animal depressing the center trip plate enough. Lighter animals may be able to get the bait without activating the trap. I advise using a big gob of peanut butter with some cereal or nuts or kibble smushed down into the peanut butter. It adds more weight and makes the creature work at it to get the nuts or cereal or kibble. You can also embed a metal nut in the peanut butter to add even more weight, if necessary.Also, if you find the bait has been taken but the trap didn&#39;t close, try using only one door open. You can easily do this by disengaging the second door cable from the setting loop.This trap does work for smaller animals but expect to experiment a little to trap your little pests. Also, be sure to check your trap at least twice a day because a small animal can dehydrate quickly in the trap, especially if it is frantically trying to get out. Releasing the animal safely is the whole reason for live traps anyway, right? So part of using these traps humanely is checking them often.When you do trap an animal, have an old towel or cloth ready to cover the cage before transporting it to a release area. The covering calms the animal down. When you reach the release area, place the trap on the ground and quietly open the trap. Move away from the trap until the animal has left and then retrieve your trap.Sometimes sharing space with small creatures causes big problems. This trap makes it easier to humanely relocate a problem animal.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Live Trap for small creatures&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403049600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

The biggest problem we have always had is ants getting inside the feeder.  I have no idea if the hummers care, but it sure makes the glass look ugly and dirty.This feeder comes with what they term an ant moat that is supposed to keep them out.  It is simply a shallow dish at the top of the unit that you fill with water.  That will work well if you keep it full, but it does only hold a few ounces of water.  Any improvement is needed and welcome.These feeders always come with &amp;#34;nectar mix&amp;#34; and if you buy it, it is fairly expensive.  All it is is sugar and you can make your own by mixing sugar and water using parts water to one part sugar...being sure to boil the water to kill any microorganisms and not make our tiny friends ill.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;This may be the best feeder I&#39;ve owned&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399680000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 10, 2014&quot;}</td>

My other Havahart trap catches many, but this one is too small and the two door thing doesn&#39;t help.  If you&#39;re trying to catch smaller critters, the easy set feature is really nice and the trap may work great, but was a failure for my intended purpose.The trap I received was a little different from the one pictured, so it might have been just a fluke that when I tried the one door method the trigger panel on the bottom was facing the wrong way.  There is a large hook on the top of the trap that holds one of the setting wires.  When you disengage that wire from the hook, the door to which the wire is attached stays closed when you set the trap.  The other wire is connected directly to the other door mechanism and can&#39;t be released.I tried the trap with both doors open first and didn&#39;t catch any critters even though the trap was sprung.  The directions say that if that happens, set it with only one door open, so I released the door wire from the top hook.  Didn&#39;t  make sense to me as the squirrel would trigger the panel before it was fully in the cage.  After multiple days, no squirrels were caught by this method nor was the trap sprung, so I decided to cut the wire to the door I thought should be the one left open (per the picture and common sense).  No takers that way either.It is hard to drop bait into the trap with only one door open because of the slant of the closed door and the fact that it&#39;s a solid panel, so I finally gave up on this trap and returned to the regular Havahart squirrel sized trap which is always effective.  It is harder to set, but more sensitive and snaps shut faster which is a requirement for squirrels.  Because it is larger, if a big squirrel comes by he will be caught just like a small squirrel, rather than springing the trap and getting away.I hoped this trap would be sturdier because eventually the other trap gets bent and won&#39;t set anymore so I have to replace it.  This one is sturdier, but since it&#39;s not effective for my needs, that doesn&#39;t help me.  I plan to put it in the barn as see if it catches mice, but will return to my regular method for squirrels.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Not for squirrels, even small ones&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399680000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 10, 2014&quot;}</td>

I start outside placing bait underneath my home, in sheds and buildings around my home hoping that they will not make it into my home.  Normally that does the trick but I had a determined little critter last winter.  He/She tripped my wooden traps, yet escaped harm; managed to find my sticky traps and left behind fuzz and hair as proof that it yet again escaped.  I had even placed bags of pellet rat/mice poison underneath my home and it still managed to leave proof in my cabinets, bathroom and utility room that it was still alive and well.A friend/co-worker recommended that I try Motomco as it was what our employer used and it ended our mice problem at work.  I placed one of the1 Pack Dispos Bait Stationunderneath the Kitchen sink.  This was the one place that I could check daily for evidence of mice.  The mouse took the bait, literally, and I have not seen it or any other signs of re-infestation since.4 Pack Dispos Bait Stationworks just as well as the refillable.  I prefer refillable as it&#39;s more economical and I have no where to recycle the type plastic the disposable stations are made of.  In order to refill you simply turn the unit over exposing the side that sits flat on the floor.  You have to hold back on a clear plastic tab with one hand and push two additional tabs towards each other and then pull out the square tube that holds the bait, replace bait and slide the tube back into the station.The package claims these are child and pet resistant.  I can see from the design that these could be difficult for little hands to open but I feel that decision rests with each parent as you know what your child is capable of and what you feel safe using.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Gets Rid of Mice&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403740800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

I have a suet feeder on a pole, that I now fill with seed cakes, that is the current favorite by all above mentioned birds.  For 2 weeks, I sporadically checked this feeder.  I had never seen one bird visit.  I had noticed the jelly dropping from the 3 drain holes in the orange plastic tray.  The ants were thankful for that.  I went out on the deck last night and heard unusual noise; sure enough, the local gimpy raccoon (has a bum leg) was tossing &amp; turning the feeder.  I didn&#39;t even bother to shoo it away or spray it with the hose.  I figured I&#39;d let him enjoy it.  He licked it clean, and for that, I&#39;m kind of grateful.

So far I have not been bothered by either when using this feeder.The feeder is an attractive copper with a glass bottle.  The bottle has a wide mouth for easy filling and the feeder comes with an initial supply of Perky Pet.  The bottom of my feeder is indeed removable and comes apart to clean the internals.  However, the bottom is plastic and does not stay connected unless I use the originally supplied twist ties to keep it affixed.  This also leads to some leakage over time.Overall &amp;#8211; this is a very attractive feeder that is well-liked by the hummers.
